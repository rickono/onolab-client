Laboratory studies suggest that complex carbon-containing nutrients (e.g., yeast or algae extract) can stimulate methane production, yet the eﬀectiveness of these nutrients within coal beds is unknown. Here, we use downhole monitoring methods in combination with deuterated water (D2O) and a 200-liter injection of 0.1\% yeast extract (YE) to stimulate and isotopically label newly generated methane. A total dissolved gas pressure sensor enabled real-time gas measurements (641 days preinjection and for 478 days postinjection). Downhole samples, collected with subsurface environmental samplers, indicate that methane increased 132\% above preinjection levels based on isotopic labeling from D2O, 108\% based on pressure readings, and 183\% based on methane measurements 266 days postinjection. Demonstrating that YE enhances biogenic coalbed methane production in situ using multiple novel measurement methods has immediate implications for other ﬁeld-scale biogenic methane investigations, including in situ methods to detect and track microbial activities related to the methanogenic turnover of recalcitrant carbon in the subsurface.},\n	language = {en},\n	number = {5},\n	urldate = {2022-03-03},\n	journal = {Environmental Science \& Technology},\n	author = {Barnhart, Elliott P. and Ruppert, Leslie F. and Hiebert, Randy and Smith, Heidi J. and Schweitzer, Hannah D. and Clark, Arthur C. and Weeks, Edwin P. and Orem, William H. and Varonka, Matthew S. and Platt, George and Shelton, Jenna L. and Davis, Katherine J. and Hyatt, Robert J. and McIntosh, Jennifer C. and Ashley, Kilian and Ono, Shuhei and Martini, Anna M. and Hackley, Keith C. and Gerlach, Robin and Spangler, Lee and Phillips, Adrienne J. and Barry, Mark and Cunningham, Alfred B. and Fields, Matthew W.},\n	month = mar,\n	year = {2022},\n	pages = {3225--3233},\n	file = {Barnhart et al. - 2022 - In Situ Enhancement and Isotopic Labeling of Bioge.pdf:/Users/shuheiono/Zotero/storage/6QZ3PI75/Barnhart et al. - 2022 - In Situ Enhancement and Isotopic Labeling of Bioge.pdf:application/pdf},\n}`,

We report new CO2 and N2 isotope and relative abundance data in exceptionally gas-rich mantle peridotite and pyroxenite xenoliths from nine localities throughout the eastern branch of the East African Rift System (EARS). Importantly for our study, the xenolith localities straddle the transition between continental and oceanic lithosphere. In addition, we report major and trace element contents together with oxygen isotopes on host crystals and bulk multiple sulfur isotope data on select pyroxene crystals from the same xenolith suite. These new data are interpreted alongside previously published He, Ne and Ar isotope and relative abundance data. Pyroxenite xenoliths formed from the infiltration and crystallization of mafic melts in the lithospheric mantle. This was followed by fluids fracturing through the pyroxenites leaving gas-rich fluid inclusions. The elemental and isotope systematics of the fluid inclusion-hosted volatile species (He, Ar, N, CO2) within the mantle xenoliths are consistent with the enrichment of the EARS SCLM by CO2-rich mantle fluids from subducted carbonate-rich material. Such CO2 enrichments (CO2/3He {\textgreater} 7 × 109, δ13C {\textasciitilde}0‰) are also associated with positive δ15N values (as high as +3.4‰), reinforcing the link between the metasomatic fluids and subduction of hydrothermally altered oceanic crust. Recycled signatures are also consistent with oxygen and sulfur isotope compositions of host crystals, which are distinct from compositions typical for the depleted upper MORB-source mantle. The occurrence of recycled volatile signatures in the EARS SCLM is widespread and must therefore be associated with a large-scale mantle process currently supplying material to EARS magmas. Notably, mantle xenoliths with high 3He/4He from the Ethiopian Rift are also associated with δ15N and δ13C values similar to the composition of sediments.

The relative composition of its isotopologues (12CH4, 13CH4, 12CH3D and 13CH3D) is used to infer its sources and sinks. The anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) is an important methane sink reaction carried out by consortia of anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) and partner bacteria in the presence of methane and sulfate. We investigated the methane isotopologue fractionations during AOM in experiments with cultures of ANME-1 archaea and partner bacteria obtained from hydrothermally heated gas-rich sediments of the Guaymas Basin. During partial methane consumption in four sets of experiments, residual methane became enriched in 13CH4 and 12CH3D, following kinetic fractionations from 11.1 to 18.3‰ and from 117 to 180‰, respectively. Results from one set of experiments with D-depleted medium water (dD = –200‰, whereas the control was –55‰) suggest the potential reversibility during the methane activation step, which would contribute to equilibrium as opposed to kinetic fractionations. The value of D13CH3D (the abundance of 13CH3D with respect to that expected from stochastic distribution) increased toward and beyond (up to 8.4‰) the value expected for isotopologue equilibrium (5.3‰ at 37 °C). The kinetic clumped isotopologue fractionation (diﬀerence between 13CH3D/12CH3D and 13CH4/12CH4 fractionations) of 4.8 to 12.8‰ is in contrast with our previous observation of little to no clumped isotopologue eﬀect during aerobic methane oxidation.

A series of photochemical experiments were performed to examine the excitation band dependence of S-MIF during the photochemistry of SO 2 under broadband light sources (a xenon arc lamp and a deuterium arc lamp). Optical filters (200±35nm bandpass and 250nm longpass filters) were used to separately access two different excitation bands of SO 2 in the 190-220nm and the 250-330nm absorption regions, respectively. UV irradiation of SO 2 in the 190-220nm and 250-330nm regions both produced elemental sulfur (S 0) and sulfur trioxide (SO 3) as end products but yielded very different sulfur isotope signatures. The elemental sulfur products from direct photolysis in the 190-220nm region were characterized by high δ 34S values (154.7-212.0‰), modest Δ 33S anomalies of 21±3‰, and relatively constant 33λ (=ln(δ 33S+1)/ln(δ 34S+1)) values of 0.64±0.3, all with respect to the initial SO 2. Photoexcitation in the 250-330nm region produced elemental sulfur with δ 34S values of 7.7-29.1‰ and Δ 33S values of 15.0±1.6‰. In both excitation regions, the SO 3 products were mass dependently fractionated relative to the SO 2 reservoir. The two different absorption regions produced contrasting Δ 36S/Δ 33S signatures in the elemental sulfur products, with Δ 36S/Δ 33S=-1.9±0.3 and 0.64±0.3 for the 190-220nm and 250-330nm bands, respectively. Our results provide several critical constraints on the origin of the S-MIF signatures observed in modern stratospheric aerosols and in the Archean geological record. A lack of S-MIF in the sulfate product and positive Δ 36S/Δ 33S ratios for the elemental sulfur from SO 2 photo-oxidation demonstrate that photoexcitation in the 250-330nm region is not a likely source for the S-MIF observed in modern stratospheric aerosols. Large δ 34S fractionation, 33λ values, and Δ 36S/Δ 33S ratios observed for the 190-220nm band are qualitatively consistent with predictions from synthetic isotopologue-specific cross sections. These isotope patterns, however, are not compatible with the Archean rock record.

The S-MIF signatures are thought to be associated with stratospheric photochemistry following stratospheric volcanic eruptions, but the exact mechanism responsible for the production and preservation of these signatures is debated. In order to identify the origin and the mechanism of preservation for these signatures, a series of laboratory photochemical experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of temperature and added O2 on the S-MIF produced by two absorption band systems of SO2: photolysis in the 190 to 220 nm region and photoexcitation in the 250 to 350 nm region. The SO2 photolysis (SO2 + hν → SO + O) experiments showed S-MIF signals with large 34S/34S fractionations, which increases with decreasing temperature. The overall S-MIF pattern observed for photolysis experiments, including high 34S/34S fractionations, positive mass-independent anomalies in 33S, and negative anomalies in 36S, is consistent with a major contribution from optical isotopologue screening effects and data for stratospheric sulfate aerosols. In contrast, SO2 photoexcitation produced products with positive S-MIF anomalies in both 33S and 36S, which is different from stratospheric sulfate aerosols. SO2 photolysis in the presence of O2 produced SO3 with S-MIF signals, suggesting the transfer of the S-MIF anomalies from SO to SO3 by the SO + O2 + M → SO3 + M reaction. This is supported with energy calculations of stationary points on the SO3 potential energy surfaces, which indicate that this reaction occurs slowly on a single adiabatic surface, but that it can occur more rapidly through intersystem crossing. Based on our experimental results, we estimate a termolecular rate constant on the order of 10-37 cm6 molecule-2 s-1. This rate can explain the preservation of mass independent isotope signatures in stratospheric sulfate aerosols and provides a minor, but important, oxidation pathway for stratospheric SO2. The production and preservation of S-MIF signals requires a high SO2 column density to allow for optical isotopologue screening effects to occur and to generate a large enough signature that it can be preserved. In addition, the SO2 plume must reach an altitude of around 20 to 25 km, where SO2 photolysis becomes a dominant process.

These unique isotope signatures signify the breakdown of the traditional theory of isotope fractionation, but the physical chemistry of these isotope effects remains poorly understood. We report the production of large sulfur isotope MIF, with δ33S up to 78 and δ36S up to 110, from the broadband excitation of SO2 in the 250-350-nm absorption region. Acetylene is used to selectively trap the triplet-state SO2 ({\textasciitilde}a3B1), which results from intersystem crossing from the excited singlet ({\textasciitilde}A1A2/{\textasciitilde}B1B1) states. The observed MIF signature differs considerably from that predicted by isotopologue-specific absorption cross-sections of SO2 and is insensitive to the wavelength region of excitation (above or below 300 nm), suggesting that the MIF originates not from the initial excitation of SO2 to the singlet states but from an isotope selective spin-orbit interaction between the singlet ({\textasciitilde}A1A2/ {\textasciitilde}B1B1) and triplet ({\textasciitilde}a3B1) manifolds.

Samples were taken from the reaction cell and analyzed for methane (12CH4, 12CH3D, 13CH4, 13CH3D) isotopologue ratios using tunable infrared laser direct absorption spectroscopy. Measured kinetic isotope effects for singly substituted species were consistent with previous experimental studies. For doubly substituted methane, 13CH3D, the observed kinetic isotope effects closely follow the product of the kinetic isotope effects for the 13C and deuterium substituted species (i.e., 13,2KIE = 13KIE × 2KIE). The deviation from this relationship is 0.3‰ ± 1.2‰ and 3.5‰ ± 0.7‰ for OH and Cl oxidation, respectively. This is consistent with model calculations performed using quantum chemistry and transition state theory. The OH and Cl reactions enrich the residual methane in the clumped isotopologue in open system reactions. In a closed system, however, this effect is overtaken by the large D/H isotope effect, which causes the residual methane to become anti-clumped relative to the initial methane.

Multiple hypotheses have been proposed for the origin(s) of this methane, ranging from synthesis via reduction of aqueous inorganic carbon (∑CO2) during active fluid circulation to leaching of methane-rich fluid inclusions from plutonic rocks of the oceanic crust. To further resolve the process(es) responsible for methane generation in these systems, we determined the relative abundances of several methane isotopologues (including 13CH3D, a “clumped” isotopologue containing two rare isotope substitutions) in hot-spring source fluids sampled from four geochemically-distinct hydrothermal vent fields (Rainbow, Von Damm, Lost City, and Lucky Strike). Apparent equilibrium temperatures retrieved from methane clumped isotopologue analyses average 310-42+53 °C, with no apparent relation to the wide range of fluid temperatures (96–370 °C) and chemical compositions (pH, [H2], [∑CO2], [CH4]) represented. Combined with very similar bulk stable isotope ratios (13C/12C and D/H) of methane across the suite of hydrothermal fluids, all available geochemical and isotopic data suggest a common mechanism of methane generation at depth that is disconnected from active fluid circulation. Attainment of equilibrium amongst methane isotopologues at temperatures of ca. 270–360 °C is compatible with the thermodynamically-favorable reduction of CO2 to CH4 at temperatures at or below ca. 400 °C under redox conditions characterizing intrusive rocks derived from sub-ridge melts. Collectively, the observations support a model where methane-rich aqueous fluids, known to be trapped in rocks of the oceanic lithosphere, are liberated from host rocks during hydrothermal circulation and perhaps represent the major source of methane venting with thermal waters at unsedimented hydrothermal fields. The results also provide further evidence that water-rock reactions occurring at temperatures lower than 200 °C do not contribute significantly to the quantities of methane venting at mid-ocean ridge hot springs.},\n	journal = {Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta},\n	author = {Wang, David T. and Reeves, Eoghan P. and McDermott, Jill M. and Seewald, Jeffrey S. and Ono, Shuhei},\n	year = {2018},\n	note = {Publisher: Elsevier Ltd},\n	keywords = {Clumped isotopologues, Methane, Fluid inclusions, Hydrogen isotope exchange, Hydrothermal vent fields},\n	pages = {141--158},\n	file = {Wang et al. - 2018 - Clumped isotopologue constraints on the origin of .pdf:/Users/shuheiono/Zotero/storage/EWDAT3U2/Wang et al. - 2018 - Clumped isotopologue constraints on the origin of .pdf:application/pdf},\n}`,

Our results indicate that observed isotopic variations are mainly controlled by mixing of mass-dependently (MD) and non-mass-dependently fractionated (non-MD) sulfur reservoirs. Based on the quadruple sulfur isotope systematics (δ34S–Δ33S–Δ36S) for these minerals, four end-member sulfur reservoirs have been recognized: (1) non-MD sulfate (δ34S = −5 ± 2‰; Δ33S = −3 ± 1‰); (2) MD sulfate (δ34S = +10 ± 3‰); (3) non-MD sulfur (δ34S {\textgreater} +6‰; Δ33S {\textgreater} +4‰); and (4) igneous MD sulfur (δ34S = Δ33S = 0‰). The first and third components show a clear non-MD signatures, thus probably represent sulfate and sulfur aerosol inputs. The MD sulfate component (2) is enriched in 34S (+10 ± 3‰) and may have originated from microbial and/or abiotic disproportionation of volcanic S or SO2. Our results reconfirm that the Dresser barites contain small amounts of pyrite depleted in 34S by 15–22‰ relative to the host barite. These barite–pyrite pairs exhibit a mass-dependent relationship of δ33S/δ34S with slope less than 0.512, which is consistent with that expected for microbial sulfate reduction and is significantly different from that of equilibrium fractionation (0.515). The barite–pyrite pairs also show up to 1‰ difference in Δ36S values and steep Δ36S/Δ33S slopes, which deviate from the main Archean array (Δ36S/Δ33S = −0.9) and are comparable to isotope effects exhibited by sulfate reducing microbes (Δ36S/Δ33S = −5 to −11).

Thus, the distribution of sulfur isotopes in sediments can trace microbial sulfate reduction (MSR), and it also has the potential to reflect the physiology of sulfate-reducing microbes. This study investigates the relationship between the availability of iron and reduced nitrogen and the magnitude of S-isotope fractionation during MSR by a marine sulfate-reducing bacterium, DMSS-1, a Desulfovibrio species, isolated from salt marsh in Cape Cod, MA. Submicromolar levels of iron increase sulfur isotope fractionation by about 50\% relative to iron-replete cultures of DMSS-1. Iron-limited cultures also exhibit decreased cytochrome c-to-total protein ratios and cell-specific sulfate reduction rates (csSRR), implying changes in the electron transport chain that couples carbon and sulfur metabolisms. When DMSS-1 fixes nitrogen in ammonium-deficient medium, it also produces larger fractionation, but it occurs at faster csSRRs than in the ammonium-replete control cultures. The energy and reducing power required for nitrogen fixation may be responsible for the reverse trend between S-isotope fractionation and csSRR in this case.

We tested mutant strains lacking one or two periplasmic (Hyd, Hyn-1, Hyn-2, and Hys) or cytoplasmic hydrogenases (Ech and CooL), and a mutant lacking type I tetraheme cytochrome (TpI-c3). In batch culture, wild-type D. vulgaris and its hydrogenase mutants had comparable growth kinetics and produced the same sulfur isotope effects. This is consistent with the reported redundancy ofhydrogenases in D. vulgaris. However, the TpI-c3 mutant (δcycA) exhibited slower growth and sulfate reduction rates in batch culture, and produced more H2 and an approximately 50\% larger sulfur isotope effect, compared to the wild type. The magnitude of sulfur isotope fractionation in the CycA deletionstrain, thus, increased due to the disrupted coupling of the carbon oxidation and sulfate reduction pathways. In continuous culture, wild-type D. vulgaris and the CycA mutant produced similar sulfur isotope effects, underscoring the influence of environmental conditions on the relative contribution of hydrogen cycling to the electron transport. The large sulfur isotope effects associated with the non-ideal stoichiometry of sulfate reduction in this study imply that simultaneous fermentation and sulfate reduction may be responsible for some of the large naturally-occurring sulfur isotope effects.

Despite the comparable carbon isotope anomalies, however, a major extinction has been reported only for the Kellwasser Events, while the punctata Event is marked by low extinction intensity. This study presents multiple sulfur isotope records of carbonate-associated sulfate (CAS) and pyrite from Late Devonian sections in the Great Basin, USA, in order to document changes in the coupled (or decoupled) geochemical cycles of carbon and sulfur during the punctata and Upper Kellwasser events. A positive sulfur isotope shift in both CAS and pyrite accompanies the onset of the punctata Event, but to a larger extent in the latter. As a result, the sulfur isotope offset between CAS and pyrite (δ34SCAS-py) dropped to less than 10‰. In the middle of the punctata Event, a sharp negative δ34SCAS excursion and negative δ34SCAS-py values coincide with the Alamo impact. Unlike the rapid δ34Spy and δ34SCAS oscillations associated with the punctata Event, the Upper Kellwasser was a period of relative stability, except for a brief δ34SCAS drop before the event. Paired sulfur isotope data, aided by a simple box model, suggest that the geochemical cycle of sulfur may have been partly responsible for the contrasting biological responses that define these events. High stratigraphic δ34Spy and δ34SCAS variability, coupled with strong reservoir effect, demonstrates a relatively small oceanic sulfate pool existed during the punctata Event. Further, the Alamo impact likely triggered the rapid oxidation of microbially-produced sulfide within this event. The expansion of sulfidic bottom water thus may have been impeded during the punctata Event. In contrast, the lack of a positive shift in δ34SCAS and sizable δ34SCAS-py values ({\textgreater}15‰) throughout the Upper Kellwasser Event imply higher relative sulfate levels. A larger seawater sulfate reservoir may have promoted the development of sulfidic bottom waters in the eutrophic epicontinental seas, increasing biological stress and potentially contributing to the mass extinction.},\n	journal = {Earth and Planetary Science Letters},\n	author = {Sim, Min Sub and Ono, Shuhei and Hurtgen, Matthew T.},\n	year = {2015},\n	note = {Publisher: Elsevier B.V.},\n	keywords = {Sulfur isotopes, Kellwasser event, Late devonian, Microbial sulfate reduction, Punctata event, Seawater sulfate},\n	pages = {52--62},\n}`,

In this study, we investigate how the coupling of carbon and sulfur metabolisms in batch and continuous cultures of a recently isolated marine sulfate reducing bacterium DMSS-1, a Desulfovibrio sp., influences the fractionation of sulfur isotopes. DMSS-1 grown in batch culture on seven different electron donors (ethanol, glycerol, fructose, glucose, lactate, malate and pyruvate) fractionates 34S/32S ratio from 6‰ to 44‰, demonstrating that the fractionations by an actively growing culture of a single incomplete oxidizing sulfate reducing microbe can span almost the entire range of previously reported values in defined cultures. The magnitude of isotope effect correlates well with cell specific sulfate reduction rates (from 0.7 to 26.1fmol/cell/day). DMSS-1 grown on lactate in continuous culture produces a larger isotope effect (21-37‰) than the lactate-grown batch culture (6‰), indicating that the isotope effect also depends on the supply rate of the electron donor and microbial growth rate. The largest isotope effect in continuous culture is accompanied by measurable changes in cell length and cellular yield that suggest starvation. The use of multiple sulfur isotopes in the model of metabolic fluxes of sulfur shows that the loss of sulfate from the cell and the intracellular reoxidation of reduced sulfur species contribute to the increase in isotope effects in a correlated manner. Isotope fractionations produced during sulfate reduction in the pure culture of DMSS-1 expand the previously reported range of triple sulfur isotope effects (32S, 33S, and 34S) by marine sulfate reducing bacteria, implying that microbial sulfur disproportionation may have a smaller 33S isotopic fingerprint than previously thought. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},\n	number = {15},\n	journal = {Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta},\n	author = {Sim, Min Sub and Ono, Shuhei and Donovan, Katie and Templer, Stefanie P. and Bosak, Tanja},\n	year = {2011},\n	pages = {4244--4259},\n	file = {Sim et al. - 2011 - Effect of electron donors on the fractionation of .pdf:/Users/shuheiono/Zotero/storage/JID5I2HA/Sim et al. - 2011 - Effect of electron donors on the fractionation of .pdf:application/pdf},\n}`,

Alteration of the oceanic crust commonly yields secondary pyrite that is depleted in 34S relative to igneous sulfides. Although these 34S depleted sulfur isotope ratios may point to signatures of biological fractionation, previous interpretations of sulfur isotope fractionation in altered volcanic rocks have relied on abiotic fractionation processes between intermediate sulfur species formed during basalt alteration. Here, we report results for multiple S-isotope (32S, 33S, 34S) compositions of altered basalts at ODP Site 801 in the western Pacific and provide evidence for microbial sulfate reduction within the volcanic oceanic crust. In-situ ion-microprobe analyses of secondary pyrite in basement rocks show a large range of δ34S values, between - 45‰ and 1‰, whereas bulk rock δ34S analyses yield a more restricted range of - 15.8 to 0.9‰. These low and variable δ34S values, together with bulk rock S concentrations ranging from 0.02\% up to 1.28\% are consistent with loss of magmatic primary mono-sulfide and addition of secondary sulfide via microbial sulfate reduction. High-precision multiple sulfur-isotope (32S/33S/34S) analyses suggest that secondary sulfides exhibit mass-dependent equilibrium fractionation relative to seawater sulfate in both δ33S and δ34S values. These relationships are explained by bacterial sulfate reduction proceeding at very low metabolic rates.

Characterizing the expected subtle variations in tropospheric N 2O isotopic composition demands high-precision and high-frequency measurements. To enable useful observations of N2O isotopic composition in tropospheric air to reduce N2O source and sink uncertainty, it was necessary to develop a high-precision measurement system with fully automated capabilities for autonomous deployment at remote research stations. METHODS A fully automated pre-concentration system for high-precision measurements of N2O isotopic composition (δ15N β, δ15Nα, δ 18O) in tropospheric air has been developed which combines a custom liquid-cryogen-free cryo-trapping system and gas chromatograph interfaced to a continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) system. A quadrupole mass spectrometer was coupled in parallel to the IRMS system during development to evaluate peak interference. Multi-port inlet and fully-automated capabilities allow streamlined analyses between in situ air inlet, air standards, flask air sample, or other gas source in exactly replicated analysis sequences. RESULTS The system has the highest precision to date for 15N site-specific composition results (δ15Nα ±0.11‰, δ15Nβ ±0.14‰ (1σ)), attributed mostly to uniformity of analytical cycles and particular attention to fluorocarbon interference noted for 15N site-specific measurements by IRMS. Air measurements demonstrated the fully automated capacity and performance.

We also demonstrate a millimeter-wave implementation of the coherence-converted population transfer scheme for background-free mmODR, which provides a ∼10-fold sensitivity improvement over the population labeling scheme. We analyze perturbations in the C state of SO2, and we rotationally assign a b2 vibrational level at 45 328 cm-1 that borrows intensity via a c-axis Coriolis interaction. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our multiplexed mmODR scheme for rapid acquisition and assignment of three predissociated vibrational levels of the C state of SO2 between 46 800 and 47 650 cm-1.},\n	number = {14},\n	journal = {Journal of Chemical Physics},\n	author = {Park, G.

In order to test whether secondary sulfide minerals are consistent with a biogenic source, we apply high precision multiple sulfur isotope analysis to bulk rock sulfide and pyrite isolates from two contrasting types of altered oceanic basement rocks, namely serpentinized peridotites and altered basalts. Samples from two peridotite sites (Iberian Margin and Hess Deep) and from a basalt site on the eastern flank of the Juan de Fuca Ridge yield overlapping δ 34S values ranging from 0‰ to -44‰. In contrast, sulfides in the basalt site are characterized by relatively low Δ 33S values ranging from -0.06‰ to 0.04‰, compared to those from peridotite sites (0.00‰ to 0.16‰). The observed Δ 33S signal is significant considering the analytical precision of 0.014‰ (2σ). We present a batch reaction model that uses observed δ 34S and Δ 33S relationships to quantify the effect of closed system processes and constrain the isotope enrichment factor intrinsic to sulfate reduction. The estimated enrichment factors as large as 61‰ and 53‰, for peridotite and basalt sites respectively, suggest the involvement of microbial sulfate reduction. The relatively high Δ 33S values in the peridotite sites are due to sulfate reduction in a closed system environment, whereas negative Δ 33S values in the basalt site reflect open system sulfate reduction. A larger extent of sulfate reduction during alteration of peridotite to serpentinite is consistent with its higher H 2 production capacity compared to basalt alteration, and further supports in-situ microbial sulfate reduction coupled with H 2 production during serpentinization reactions. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},\n	journal = {Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta},\n	author = {Ono, Shuhei and Keller, Nicole S. and Rouxel, Olivier and Alt, Jeffrey C.},\n	month = jun,\n	year = {2012},\n	pages = {323--340},\n}`,

Together with textural observation by SEM, Pb isotope analyses and chemical compositions of brannerite and uranothorite, our data revealed a protracted uranium remobilization history for the uranium deposits in the Elliot Lake district.All grains of uraninite examined show consistently high Th contents, supporting detrital origin of uraninite derived from pegmatitic rocks. The unimodal distribution of Th concentration of uraninite excludes the possibility that uraninite formed by multiple pathways, where some grains are detrital and some are later diagenetic/hydrothermal in origin. The measured uraninite grains yield U-Pb discordia age of 1.8. Ga, which is much younger than the depositional age of the host Huronian Basin (2.45 to 2.2. Ga). This age closely corresponds with the age of peak metamorphism in the Huronian Basin, suggesting that all uraninite grains completely lost its Pb during this time.The least texturally and chemically altered grains of uraninite yield δ18O-SMOW values of -10 to -22 ‰. This range of δ18O value is lower than that expected for uraninite from granitic/pegmatitic rocks by 10 ‰. It is concluded that the oxygen isotope ratios of uraninite is completely reset during the peak metamorphism and/or by interaction with recent meteoric water. The δ18O of uraninite, however, do not show systematic variation with Th/U, Pb/U and 207Pb/206Pb ratios, indicating uraninite exchanged its O isotopes without much disturbance in its chemical composition.Among the various geochemical signatures in uraninite, high Th content is the only original signature preserved since detrital deposition of uraninite.

The Δ 33S values from nine samples ranges from -0.49 to +0.36 0/00, which is considerably smaller than what was measured for the sulfide and sulfate minerals from other Archean intervals but outside the range of Δ33S values measured for post-2.0 Ga sulfide and sulfate minerals. Moreover, some samples from the Mozaan Group yield Δ36S/Δ33S ratios that are different from Phanerozoic sulfides, suggesting sulfide sulfur from the Mozaan Group carries mass-independent isotope fractionation originated from atmospheric photochemistry. The relatively small Δ 33S values for the Mozaan Group may suggest that the atmosphere became slightly oxidized at ∼2.9 Ga with oxygen level above 10-5 but below 10-2 times present atmospheric level. This intermediate oxygen level would allow production of S-MIF in atmospheric chemistry but prohibit preservation of large S-MIF signatures in surface deposits.

Measured Δ33S (≈ δ33S-0.515δ34S) values range between -2.3 and +8.5‰ with no apparent meter-scale stratigraphic trend for 70 m section. It was found that early diagenetic pyrites occur in two texturally and isotopically distinct populations such that bulk rock isotope data would reflect mixing of these two sulfur pools. Nodular and layered pyrite yield mostly negative (down to -2.3‰) and relatively constant Δ33S values over a few tens of cm scale. Disseminated pyrites, in contrast, yield positive (0.0-8.5‰) Δ33S values that are heterogeneous in sub-cm scales. The former pyrite sulfur was likely derived from seawater sulfate through microbial sulfate reduction, and the latter preferentially sampled aqueous H2S-S0 reservoirs in late Archean oceans. Relatively constant Δ33S values for layered pyrite suggest Archean sulfate reservoirs had residence times of a few million years. Most data yield a well-defined Δ36S/Δ33S ratios of -0.9, suggesting predominance of a single S-MIF source reaction. Four analyses of a two cm length sample (306.5 m) yield Δ36S/Δ33S slope of -1.6. This slope is consistent with the relationship expected for a symmetry-breaking isotope effect during the S + S2 reaction, but deviations from the main Archean array (i.e., Δ36S/Δ33S = -0.9) may also result from various combinations of SO photolysis and SO2 oxidation.

Conventional sulfur isotope studies, however, are inconclusive about the mass-balance between the two sources because 34S/32S ratios of vent fluid H2S and chimney sulfide minerals may reflect not only the mixing ratio but also isotope exchange between sulfate and sulfide. Here, we show that high-precision analysis of S-33 can provide a unique constraint because isotope mixing and isotope exchange result in different Δ33S (≡δ33S-0.515 δ34S) values of up to 0.04‰ even if δ34S values are identical. Detection of such small Δ33S differences is technically feasible by using the SF6 dual-inlet mass-spectrometry protocol that has been improved to achieve a precision as good as 0.006‰ (2σ). Sulfide minerals (marcasite, pyrite, chalcopyrite, and sphalerite) and vent H2S collected from four active seafloor hydrothermal vent sites, East Pacific Rise (EPR) 9-10°N, 13°N, and 21°S and Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) 37°N yield Δ33S values ranging from -0.002 to 0.033 and δ34S from -0.5‰ to 5.3‰. The combined δ34S and Δ33S systematics reveal that 73 to 89\% of vent sulfides are derived from leaching from basaltic sulfide and only 11 to 27\% from seawater-derived sulfate. Pyrite from EPR 13°N and marcasite from MAR 37°N are in isotope disequilibrium not only in δ34S but also in Δ33S with respect to associated sphalerite and chalcopyrite, suggesting non-equilibrium sulfur isotope exchange between seawater sulfate and sulfide during pyrite precipitation. Seafloor hydrothermal vent sulfides are characterized by low Δ33S values compared with biogenic sulfides, suggesting little or no contribution of sulfide from microbial sulfate reduction into hydrothermal sulfides at sediment-free mid-oceanic ridge systems.

These two deep-time cores are correlated to each other with 14 tie lines using volcanic and impact spherule layers in a sequence stratigraphic framework, allowing us to evaluate both lithofacies and temporal controls over multiple-sulfur isotope systematics. The ca. 2.5 Ga (giga-annum before present) basinal Klein Naute Formation and the ca. 2.6 Ga peritidal Boomplaas and Vryburg Formations yield an array of data characterized by δ33S ≈ 1.4 × δ34S. These linear trends are found in both shallow water and deepwater facies but are characteristic to rocks with high-iron content suggesting these may reflect isotopic compositions of aqueous sulfide-elemental sulfur reservoirs in the Neoarchean oceans. Data that deviate from this linear array are interpreted as resulting from additional inputs of sulfide from microbial sulfate reduction with or without contribution from sulfur disproportionation. Sulfate-derived sulfur evolved to be either enriched or depleted in 34S depending on the local depositional environment. For example, the Reivilo Formation in core GKF01 is characterized by abundant microbialite textures and shows an isotopic signature of closed system sulfate reduction. Rapid cementation of these carbonate fabrics may have attenuated the supply of sulfate to pore waters resulting in the progressive 34S enrichments during bacterial sulfate reduction below the sediment-water interface. In contrast, signatures of open-system sulfate reduction are associated with slope facies, dominated by granular dolostones, preserved in the upper Nauga Formations in GKF01 and GKP01. The two different sulfur isotope patterns, interpreted to reflect closed versus open-system sulfate reduction are both found in the lower Reivilo Formation in both cores. This lateral variation of isotope signals documents that observed 34S shifts can be controlled locally, and may not have temporal significance.

We have developed a new method to precisely determine the relative abundance of 13CH3D by using tunable infrared laser direct absorption spectroscopy (TILDAS). The TILDAS instrument houses two continuous wave quantum cascade lasers; one tuned at 8.6 μm to measure 13CH3D, 12CH3D, and 12CH4, and the other at 7.5 μm to measure 13CH4.

Smaller quantity samples (ca. 0.5 mL STP) can be measured at lower precision. The accuracy of the Δ13CH3D measurement is 0.7‰ (2σ), evaluated by thermally equilibrating methane with a range of δD values. The precision of ±0.2‰ corresponds to uncertainties of ±7 °C at 25 °C and ±20 °C at 200 °C for estimates of apparent equilibrium temperatures.

The stratigraphic distribution of δ33S, δ34S, and Δ33S in Western Australia allows us to speculate on the sulfur isotopic composition of Archean sulfur reservoirs and to trace pathways in the Archean sulfur cycle.

In the Archean, volcanic, sulfur-bearing gas species were photolysed by solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation in an oxygen-free atmosphere, resulting in MIF of sulfur isotopes. Aerosols of S8 (with Δ33S {\textgreater} 0) and sulfuric acid (with Δ33S {\textless} 0) formed from the products of UV photolysis and carried mass-independently fractionated sulfur into the hydrosphere. The signatures of atmospheric photolysis were preserved by precipitation of pyrite in sediments. Pyrite precipitation was mediated by microbial enzymatic catalysis that superimposed mass-dependent fractionation on mass-independent atmospheric effects. Multiple sulfur isotope analyses provide new insights into the early evolution of the atmosphere and the evolution and distribution of early sulfur-metabolizing organisms. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

These anomalous relationships, referred to as sulfur mass-independent fractionation (S-MIF), provide strong evidence for an early anoxic atmosphere. Correlated variations among three isotope ratios (δ 33 S, δ 34 S, and δ 36 S) can be observed in rocks throughout the Archean and are a key clue toward identifying the source reaction of S-MIF. Studies to investigate the origin of Archean S-MIF so far have primarily focused on the photochemistry of sulfur dioxide (SO2). Photolysis of SO2 at wavelengths {\textless} 220 nm and photoexcitation at 240-340 nm both yield large-magnitude S-MIF. Proposed mechanisms of S-MIF include isotopologue-dependent self-shielding, cross-sectional amplitudes, and vibronic coupling during intersystem crossing.

The model includes lateral and vertical advection as well as vertical diffusion, which are found to be significant components of the seasonal budgets of oxygen, DIC and nitrate. The vertical and seasonal variation of the remineralization rates deduced from the oxygen and DIC distributions are very similar. Both locate the spring-summer community compensation depth at ∼ 85m and the remineralization rate maximum at ∼ 120 m; nitrate-based estimates of these depths are about 40m greater. Remineralization rates based on oxygen, DIC and nitrate all show the seasonal maximum to occur in the late spring, presumably reflecting the decomposition of organic matter formed during the spring bloom. The remineralization rate integrated between 100 and 250 m and between mid-April and mid-December is estimated to be 2.08 ± 0.38 mol O2 m-2, 1.53 ± 0.35 mol Cm-2 and 0.080 ± 0.046 mol Nm-2.

The diversity and ecophysiological role of soil microorganisms that can consume low atmospheric abundances of H2 with high-affinity [NiFe]-hydrogenases is unknown. We expanded the library of atmospheric H2-consuming strains to include four soil Harvard Forest Isolate (HFI) Streptomyces spp., Streptomyces cattleya and Rhodococcus equi by assaying for high-affinity hydrogenase (hhyL) genes and quantifying H2 uptake rates. We find that aerial structures (hyphae and spores) are important for StreptomycesH2 consumption; uptake was not observed in S.griseoflavusTu4000 (deficient in aerial structures) and was reduced by physical disruption of Streptomyces sp. HFI8 aerial structures. H2 consumption depended on the life cycle stage in developmentally distinct actinobacteria: Streptomyces sp. HFI8 (sporulating) and R.equi (non-sporulating, non-filamentous). Strain HFI8 took up H2 only after forming aerial hyphae and sporulating, while R.equi only consumed H2 in the late exponential and stationary phase. These observations suggest that conditions favouring H2 uptake by actinobacteria are associated with energy and nutrient limitation.

Due to its great depth, the Piccard site is an excellent natural system for investigating the influence of extreme pressure on the formation of submarine vent fluids. To investigate the role of rock composition and deep circulation conditions on fluid chemistry, the abundance and isotopic composition of organic, inorganic, and dissolved volatile species in high temperature vent fluids at Piccard were examined in samples collected in 2012 and 2013. Fluids from the Beebe Vents and Beebe Woods black smokers vent at a maximum temperature of 398 °C at the seafloor, however several lines of evidence derived from inorganic chemistry (Cl, SiO2, Ca, Br, Fe, Cu, Mn) support fluid formation at much higher temperatures in the subsurface. These high temperatures, potentially in excess of 500 °C, are attainable due to the great depth of the system. Our data indicate that a single deep-rooted source fluid feeds high temperature vents across the entire Piccard field. High temperature Piccard fluid H2 abundances (19.9 mM) are even higher than those observed in many ultramafic-influenced systems, such as the Rainbow (16 mM) and the Von Damm hydrothermal fields (18.2 mM). In the case of Piccard, however, these extremely high H2 abundances can be generated from fluid-basalt reaction occurring at very high temperatures. Magmatic and thermogenic sources of carbon in the high temperature black smoker vents are described. Dissolved ΣCO2 is likely of magmatic origin, CH4 may originate from a combination of thermogenic sources and leaching of abiotic CH4 from mineral-hosted fluid inclusions, and CO abundances are at equilibrium with the water–gas shift reaction. Longer-chained n-alkanes (C2H6, C3H8, n-C4H10, i-C4H10) may derive from thermal alteration of dissolved and particulate organic carbon sourced from the original seawater source, entrainment of microbial ecosystems peripheral to high temperature venting, and/or abiotic mantle sources. Dissolved ΣHCOOH in the Beebe Woods fluid is consistent with thermodynamic equilibrium for abiotic production via ΣCO2 reduction with H2 at 354 °C measured temperature. A lack of ΣHCOOH in the relatively higher temperature 398 °C Beebe Vent fluids demonstrates the temperature sensitivity of this equilibrium. Abundant basaltic seafloor outcrops and the axial location of the vent field, along with multiple lines of geochemical evidence, support extremely high temperature fluid-rock reaction with mafic substrate as the dominant control on Piccard fluid chemistry. These results expand the known diversity of vent fluid composition, with implications for supporting microbiological life in both the modern and ancient ocean.},\n	journal = {Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta},\n	author = {McDermott, Jill M. and Sylva, Sean P. and Ono, Shuhei and German, Christopher R. and Seewald, Jeffrey S.},\n	year = {2018},\n	note = {Publisher: Elsevier Ltd},\n	pages = {95--118},\n	file = {McDermott et al. - 2018 - Geochemistry of fluids from Earth's deepest ridge-.pdf:/Users/shuheiono/Zotero/storage/W4JMWEQG/McDermott et al. - 2018 - Geochemistry of fluids from Earth's deepest ridge-.pdf:application/pdf},\n}`,

Chalcopyrite and dissolved hydrogen sulfide (H{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}S) δ$^{\textrm{34}}$S values range from -5.5‰ to +5.6‰ in Manus Basin samples, +2.4‰ to +6.1‰ in Lau Basin samples, and +3.7‰ to +5.7‰ in SEPR samples.

At PACMANUS and SuSu Knolls hydrothermal systems in the Eastern Manus Basin, a significant contribution of sulfur is derived from disproportionation of magmatic sulfur dioxide (SO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}), while the remaining sulfur is derived from crustal host rocks and SO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} reduction. At the sedimented Guaymas Basin hydrothermal system, sulfur sources include crustal host rock, reduced seawater SO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, and biogenic sulfide. Vent fluid flow through fresher, less-mature sediment supplies an increased quantity of reactant organic compounds that may reduce $^{\textrm{34}}$S-enriched SO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, while fluid interaction with more highly-altered sediments results in H{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}S characterized by a small, but isotopically-significant input of $^{\textrm{34}}$S-depleted biogenic sulfides.Near-zero δ$^{\textrm{33}}$S values in all samples implicate the abiotic processes of SO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} reduction and leaching of host rock as the major contributors to sulfur content at a high temperature unsedimented mid-ocean ridge and at a back-arc system. δ$^{\textrm{33}}$S values indicate that SO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} disproportionation is an additional process that contributes sulfur to a different back-arc system and to acid spring-type hydrothermal fluid circulation. At the sedimented Guaymus Basin, near-zero δ$^{\textrm{33}}$S values are also observed, despite negative δ$^{\textrm{34}}$S values that indicate inputs of biogenic pyrite for some samples.In contrast with previous studies reporting isotope disequilibrium between H{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}S and chalcopyrite, the δ$^{\textrm{34}}$S values of chalcopyrite sampled from the inner 1-2mm of a chimney wall are within ±1‰ of δ$^{\textrm{34}}$S values for H{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}S in the paired vent fluid, suggesting equilibrium fluid-mineral sulfur isotope exchange at 300-400°C.

Our results show that upper Rhaetian strata are characterized by 34S-enriched pyrite, low Spy/TOC ratios, and values of Δ33Spy (i.e., the deviation from the mass-dependent array) lower than that estimated for contemporaneous seawater sulfate, suggesting an oxic-suboxic depositional environment punctuated by brief anoxic events.

Accordingly, the sulfur isotopic composition (δ34S) of pyrite has been widely employed as a geochemical tool to probe the evolution of ocean chemistry. Characteristics of the depositional environment and post-depositional processes, however, can modify the δ34S signal that is captured in sedimentary pyrite and ultimately preserved in the geological record. Exploring sulfur and iron diagenesis within the Bornholm Basin, Baltic Sea, we find that higher sedimentation rates limit the near-surface sulfidization of reactive iron, facilitating its burial and hence the subsurface availability of reactive iron for continued and progressively more 34S-enriched sediment-hosted pyrite formation (δ34S ≈ –5‰). Using a diagenetic model, we show that the amount of pyrite formed at the sediment-water interface has increased over the past few centuries in response to expansion of water-column hypoxia, which also impacts the sulfur isotopic signature of pyrite at depth. This contribution highlights the critical role of reactive iron in pyrite formation and questions to what degree pyrite δ34S values truly reflect past global ocean chemistry and biogeochemical processes.

The OCS gas at 3.7 to 501 mbar was irradiated with or without a N2 bath gas using a 150 W Xe arc lamp. Sulfur isotope ratios for the product S0 and residual OCS were analyzed by an isotope ratio mass-spectrometer with SF6 as the analyte gas. The isotope fractionation after correction for the reservoir effects is-6.8\% for the ratio 34S/32S, where product S0 is depleted in heavy isotopes. The magnitude of the overall isotope effect is not sensitive to the addition of N2 but increases to-9.5\% when radiation of lambda; {\textgreater} 285 nm is used. The measured isotope effect reflects that of photolysis as well as the subsequent sulfur abstraction (from OCS) reaction. The magnitude of isotope effects for the abstraction reaction is estimated by transition state theory to be between-18.9 and-3.1\% for 34S which gives the photolysis isotope effect as-10.5 to +5.3\%.

Sulfate reducing microorganisms can impart a wide range in mass-dependent sulfur isotopic fractionation. As such, the presence and relative activity of these organisms is identifiable from geological materials. By extension, sulfur isotope records are used to infer the redox balance of marine sedimentary environments, and the oxidation state of Earth's oceans and atmosphere. However, recent work suggests that our understanding of microbial sulfate reduction (MSRs) may be missing complexity associated with the presence and role of key chemical intermediates in the reductive process. This study provides a test of proposed metabolic models of sulfate reduction by growing an axenic culture of the well-studied MSRs, Desulfovibrio alaskensis strain G20, under electron donor limited conditions on the terminal electron acceptors sulfate, sulfite or thiosulfate, and tracking the multiple S isotopic consequences of each condition set. The dissimilatory reduction of thiosulfate and sulfite produce unique minor isotope effects, as compared to the reduction of sulfate. Further, these experiments reveal a complex biochemistry associated with sulfite reduction. That is, under high sulfite concentrations, sulfur is shuttled to an intermediate pool of thiosulfate. Site-specific isotope fractionation (within thiosulfate) is very large (34ε {\textasciitilde} 30‰) while terminal product sulfide carries only a small fractionation from the initial sulfite (34ε {\textless} 10‰): a signature similar in magnitude to sulfate and thiosulfate reduction.

Recent investigations showed that, in some deep, fluid-filled fractures in the Witwatersrand Basin, South Africa, methanogens contribute {\textless}5\% of the total DNA and appear to produce sufficient CH4 to support the rest of the diverse community. This paradoxical situation reflects our lack of knowledge about the in situ metabolic diversity and the overall ecological trophic structure of SLiMEs. Here, we show the active metabolic processes and interactions in one of these communities by combining metatranscriptomic assemblies, metaproteomic and stable isotopic data, and thermodynamic modeling. Dominating the active community are four autotrophic β-proteobacterial genera that are capable of oxidizing sulfur by denitrification, a process that was previously unnoticed in the deep subsurface. They co-occur with sulfate reducers, anaerobic methane oxidizers, and methanogens, which each comprise {\textless}5\% of the total community. Syntrophic interactions between these microbial groups remove thermodynamic bottlenecks and enable diverse metabolic reactions to occur under the oligotrophic conditions that dominate in the subsurface. The dominance of sulfur oxidizers is explained by the availability of electron donors and acceptors to these microorganisms and the ability of sulfur-oxidizing denitrifiers to gain energy through concomitant S and H2 oxidation. We demonstrate that SLiMEs support taxonomically and metabolically diverse microorganisms, which, through developing syntrophic partnerships, overcome thermodynamic barriers imposed by the environmental conditions in the deep subsurface.},\n	number = {49},\n	journal = {Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America},\n	author = {Lau, Maggie C.Y. and Kieft, Thomas L. and Kuloyo, Olukayode and Linage-Alvarez, Borja and Van Heerden, Esta and Lindsay, Melody R. and Magnabosco, Cara and Wang, Wei and Wiggins, Jessica B. and Guo, Ling and Perlman, David H. and Kyin, Saw and Shwe, Henry H. and Harris, Rachel L. and Oh, Youmi and Yi, Min Joo and Purtschert, Roland and Slater, Greg F. and Ono, Shuhei and Wei, Siwen and Li, Long and Lollar, Barbara Sherwood and Onstott, Tullis C.},\n	year = {2016},\n	keywords = {Active subsurface environment, Inverted biomass pyramid, Metabolic interactions, Sulfur-driven autotrophic denitrifiers, Syntrophy},\n	pages = {E7927--E7936},\n}`,

Although S-MIF is generally thought to be exclusive to gas phase chemistry, several studies have suggested that liquid phase or heterogeneous chemistry may also produce S-MIF signatures.This study investigates the potential contribution of the poorly explored mass-independent effects from liquid phase sulfur chemistry. Our investigation focused on laboratory experiments of the UV photolysis of phenacylphenylsulfone as a model system. This system was chosen due to previous measurements of Δ 33S (not Δ 36S) by a low precision SO 2 method indicating the occurrence of anomalous fractionation in 33S.The photolysis of PPS in micellar solution produced MIF of 33S in residual PPS ranging from depletion by -2.1‰ to enrichment by 6.4‰, with small mass-dependent fractionation of δ 34S up to 2.1‰. While this magnitude of 33S anomaly is comparable to the range of values observed in Archean rocks, no anomaly in 36S was detected for the 32S- 34S- 36S system beyond analytical precision (0.19‰). These results confirm the anomalous fractionation to be caused most likely by magnetic isotope effects (MIE), affecting only the nuclear spin possessing 33S among the four stable isotopes of sulfur. The observed initial depletion of 33S in the reactant PPS was unexpected and suggests changing contributions of at least two spin-selective processes. The results of this study demonstrate that liquid phase processes, such as the photolysis of certain organic sulfur compounds, can produce anomalous 33S abundance. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},\n	journal = {Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta},\n	author = {Kopf, Sebastian and Ono, Shuhei},\n	year = {2012},\n	pages = {160--169},\n}`,

The presence of diamictites in the Pongola Supergroup and the Witwatersrand Basin of South Africa suggests that by 2.9 Ga the climate was glacial. The Late Archaean was relatively warm; then glaciation (possibly of global extent) reappeared in the Early Palaeoproterozoic, around 2.3-2.4 Ga. Fitting these climatic constraints with a model requires high concentrations of atmospheric CO2 or CH4, or both. Solar luminosity was 20-25\% lower than today, so elevated greenhouse gas concentrations were needed just to keep the mean surface temperature above freezing. A rise in O 2 at approximately 2.4 Ga, and a concomitant decrease in CH 4, provides a natural explanation for the Palaeoproterozoic glaciations.

The most important sink of atmospheric methane is oxidation by OH in the troposphere, which accounts for around 84\% of all methane removal. Here we present experimentally derived methane+OH kinetic isotope effects and their temperature dependence over the range of 278 to 313K for CH3D and 13CH3D; the latter is reported here for the first time. We find kCH4/kCH3D Combining double low line 1.31 ± 0.01 and kCH4/k13CH3D Combining double low line 1.34 ± 0.03 at room temperature, implying that the methane+OH kinetic isotope effect is multiplicative such that (kCH4/k13CH4)(kCH4/kCH3D) Combining double low line kCH4/k13CH3D, within the experimental uncertainty, given the literature value of kCH4/k13CH4 Combining double low line 1.0039 ± 0.0002.

This paper presents laboratory measurements of the fractionation factors for the major atmospheric oxidation reactions for SO2: Gas-phase oxidation by OH radicals, and aqueous oxidation by H2O 2, O3 and a radical chain reaction initiated by iron. The measured fractionation factor for 34S/32S during the gas-phase reaction is αOH Combining double low line (1.0089\&plusmn;0.0007)-((4\&plusmn;5) \&times;10-5) T( C).

The observed fractionation during oxidation by H 2O2 and O3 appeared to be controlled primarily by protonation and acid-base equilibria of S(IV) in solution, which is the reason that there is no significant difference between the fractionation produced by the two oxidants within the experimental error. The isotopic fractionation factor from a radical chain reaction in solution catalysed by iron is αFe Combining double low line (0.9894\&plusmn;0.0043) at 19 C for 34S/32S.

Trapping of N2O is quantitative up to a sample size of ∼4 L, with an optimal sample size of 1200-1800 mL at a sampling frequency of 28 min. Line shape variations with the partial pressure of the major matrix gases N 2/O2 and CO2 are measured, and show that characterization of both pressure broadening and Dicke narrowing is necessary for an optimal spectral fit. Partial pressure variations of CO2 and bath gas result in a linear isotopic measurement offset of 2.6-6.0 ‰ mbar-1. Comparison of IR MS and TILDAS measurements shows that the TILDAS technique is accurate and precise, and less susceptible to interferences than IR MS measurements. Two weeks of measurements of N2O isotopic composition from Cambridge, MA, in May 2013 are presented. The measurements show significant short-term variability in N2O isotopic composition larger than the measurement precision, in response to meteorological parameters such as atmospheric pressure and temperature. © 2013 American Chemical Society.},\n	number = {3},\n	journal = {Analytical Chemistry},\n	author = {Harris, Eliza and Nelson, David D. and Olszewski, William and Zahniser, Mark and Potter, Katherine E. and McManus, Barry J. and Whitehill, Andrew and Prinn, Ronald G. and Ono, Shuhei},\n	year = {2014},\n	pages = {1726--1734},\n}`,

Although temperature dependence of fractionation factors was found to be significant for H 2O2 and TMI-catalyzed pathways, results from a simple 1D model revealed that changing partitioning between oxidation pathways was the dominant cause of seasonality in the isotopic composition of sulfate relative to SO2. Comparison of modeled seasonality with observations shows the TMI-catalyzed oxidation pathway is underestimated by more than an order of magnitude in all current atmospheric chemistry models. The three reactions showed an approximately mass-dependent relationship between 33S and 34S. However, the slope of the mass-dependent line was significantly different to 0.515 for the OH and TMI-catalyzed pathways, reflecting kinetic versus equilibrium control of isotopic fractionation. For the TMI-catalyzed pathway, both temperature dependence and 33S/34S relationship revealed a shift in the rate-limiting reaction step from dissolution at lower temperatures to TMI-sulfite complex formation at higher temperatures. 1D model results showed that although individual reactions could produce Δ33S values between -0.15 and +0.2‰, seasonal changes in partitioning between oxidation pathways caused average sulfate Δ33S values of 0‰ throughout the year. © 2013 American Chemical Society.},\n	number = {21},\n	journal = {Environmental Science and Technology},\n	author = {Harris, Eliza and Sinha, Bärbel and Hoppe, Peter and Ono, Shuhei},\n	year = {2013},\n	pages = {12174--12183},\n	file = {Harris et al. - 2013 - High-precision measurements of 33S and 34S fractio.pdf:/Users/shuheiono/Zotero/storage/4NETEYP3/Harris et al. - 2013 - High-precision measurements of 33S and 34S fractio.pdf:application/pdf},\n}`,

These geochemical data vary relative to depositional facies (proximal marine, distal marine and fluvial-dominated) and tectonic setting (trailing margin and foreland basin).In the trailing margin setting of the {\textasciitilde}2.96Ga Hospital Hill Subgroup, the proximal marine depofacies is characterized by relatively high organic carbon contents (up to 0.9wt.\%) and δ 13C org values around -28‰, in contrast to the distal marine depofacies that yields low organic carbon contents (0.01wt.\%) and high δ 13C org values (up to -22‰). Both depofacies yield low sulfur contents (0.02wt.‰), a narrow range of δ 34S values ({\textasciitilde}+3±2‰) and positive Δ 33S values (up to +1.9‰). This data is consistent with photoautotrophic carbon fixation in shallow marine environments and limited organic carbon production/preservation in deeper water settings due to longer transport distances and effective biological degradation (e.g., Fe-reducing microbes). Positive Δ 33S values imply that sulfur was largely derived from a photochemical elemental sulfur reservoir. In the foreland basin tectonic setting of the {\textasciitilde}2.94Ga Government and {\textasciitilde}2.92Ga Jeppestown subgroups, shelf deposits associated with fluvial braidplain depofacies are characterized by 13C-depleted organic carbon ({\textasciitilde}-44 to -38‰), relatively high sulfur contents (0.2-1.3wt.\%), variable δ 34S values (-3.7 to +16.5‰) and small negative Δ 33S values ({\textasciitilde}-0.4‰). These data suggest that the microbial community in the fluvial-dominated depofacies may have consisted of photoautotrophs, methanogens, anaerobic methanotrophs and sulfate reducers. Sulfate was derived from a variety of sources that include photochemical, crustal and marine sulfur reservoirs.The occurrence of three regionally persistent diamictite deposits in the Government Subgroup coincides with the onset of compressional tectonics and development of pyritic shales with highly 13C-depleted organic carbon, suggesting that an increase in continental sulfur flux and methane oxidation may have triggered the Mesoarchean glaciations (drawdown of H 2 and CH 4).

The multiple sulfur isotope values of the thermal fluids are interpreted to reflect various sources of sulfur in the fluids, as well as isotope fractionation occurring within the geothermal systems associated with fluid-rock interaction, boiling and oxidation and reduction reactions. The results of isotope geochemical modeling demonstrate that the sources of S− IIin the thermal fluid are leaching of basalt (MORB) and seawater SO4reduction for saline systems with insignificant magma gas input, and that the observed ranges of δ34S and Δ33S for ∑ S− IIand H2S(g) reflect isotope fractionation between minerals and aqueous and gaseous species upon fluid-rock interaction and boiling. The sources of SO4are taken to be multiple, including oxidation of S− IIoriginating from basalt, leaching of SVIfrom the basalts and the seawater itself in the case of saline systems. In low-temperature fluids, the δ34S and Δ33S values reflect the various sources of sulfur. For high-temperature fluids, fluid-rock interaction, ∑ S− IIoxidation and SO4reduction and sulfide and sulfate mineral formation result in a large range of δ34S and Δ33S values for ∑ S− IIand SO4in the fluids, highlighting the importance and effects of chemical reactions on the isotope systematics of reactive elements like sulfur.

To study the effect of this eruption on the winter precipitation, snow cores were collected from the Vatnajökull glacier and the highlands northeast of the glacier. In addition to 29 bulk snow cores from that precipitated from September 2014 until March 2015, two cores were sampled in 21 and 44 increments to quantify the spatial and time evolution of the chemical composition of the snow. The pH and chemical compositions of melted snow samples indicate that snow has been affected by the volcanic gases emitted during the Bárðarbunga eruption. The pH of the melted bulk snow cores ranged from 4.41 to 5.64 with an average value of 5.01. This is four times greater H+ activity than pure water saturated with the atmospheric CO2. The highest concentrations of volatiles in the snow cores were found close to the eruption site as predicted from CALPUFF SO2 gas dispersion quality model. The anion concentrations (SO4, Cl, and F) were higher and the pH was lower compared to equivalent snow samples collected during 1997–2006 from the unpolluted Icelandic Langjökull glacier. Higher SO4 and Cl concentrations in the snow compared with the unpolluted rainwater of marine origin confirm the addition of a non–seawater SO4 and Cl. The δ34S isotopic composition confirms that the sulphur addition is of volcanic aerosol origin. The chemical evolution of the snow with depth reflects changes in the lava effusion and gas emission rates. Those rates were the highest at the early stage of the eruption. Snow that fell during that time, represented by samples from the deepest part of the snow cores, had the lowest pH and highest concentrations of SO4, F, Cl and metals, compared with snow that fell later in the winter. Also the Al concentration, did exceed World Health Organisation drinking water standard of 3.7 μmol/kg in the lower part of the snow core closest to the eruption site. Collected snow represents the precipitation that fell during the eruption period. Nevertheless, only minor environmental impacts are evident in the snow due to its interaction with the volcanic aerosol gases.

Sourcing methane from the Tablelands has thus far been limited because of the low dissolved methane concentrations. We tested dissolved gas extraction and concentration methods (vacuum extraction and gas stripping) for their effect on isotopic fractionation, and we applied these methods to sample dissolved methane for carbon and hydrogen isotopes (δ13CCH4 and δDCH4) as well as doubly substituted “clumped” isotopologue (13CH3D) analyses. Clumped isotope thermometry of methane estimated an apparent temperature of 85 ± 7 °C.

On a carbon deuterium (CD) plot, the Tablelands methane data plotted outside of the microbial field, but within an area where abiogenic and thermogenic fields overlap. A conclusive discrimination between abiogenic and thermogenic methanogenic pathways remains challenging.

The metasedimentary rocks display a range of metamorphic grades increasing from biotite-chlorite (280-380 °C) at ∼5 km away from the GLB to sillimanite-K-feldspar grade (∼660 °C) immediately adjacent to the batholith, thus providing a natural experiment to understand sulfur isotope variations from low- to high-grade Archean sedimentary rocks, as well as granites representative of their partial melts. We find that metasedimentary sulfide δ34S values increase with progressive metamorphism at most 2-3‰ (from −1‰ up to +1 to +2‰). An increase in δ34S values in pyrrhotite during prograde metamorphism can be explained through Rayleigh fractionation during pyrite desulfidation reactions. Pyrite from all but one of the granite samples preserve δ34S values similar to that of the high-grade metasedimentary rocks, indicating that partial melting did not result in significant fractionation of δ34S. The exception to this is one granite sample from a part of the batholith characterized by abundant metasedimentary inclusions. This sample contains pyrite with heterogeneous and low δ34S values (down to −16‰) which likely resulted from incomplete homogenization of sulfur between the granitic melt and metasedimentary inclusions. Small (several tenths of a permil), mostly positive Δ33S are observed in both the metasedimentary rocks and granites. Our results suggest that Archean strongly peraluminous granites could be a high-fidelity archive to quantify the bulk sulfur isotope composition of the Archean siliciclastic sediments. Further, our findings indicate that subduction of reduced sulfur-bearing sediments in the Archean with δ34S at or near 0‰ should result in release of sulfur-bearing fluids in the mantle wedge with similar values (within a few permil). S-MIF (if initially present in Archean surface material) may be preserved during this process. However, the absence of S-MIF in igneous rocks does not preclude assimilation of Archean sedimentary material as either S-MIF may not be originally present in the Archean sedimentary sulfur and/or homogenization or dilution could obscure any S-MIF originally present in assimilated Archean sediments.},\n	journal = {Earth and Planetary Science Letters},\n	author = {Bucholz, Claire E. and Biasi, Joseph A. and Beaudry, Patrick and Ono, Shuhei},\n	year = {2020},\n	keywords = {Archean, anatexis, granite, metasedimentary rocks, sulfur},\n	pages = {116494--116494},\n}`,

In addition to the oxidation of buried organic matter, sulfate reduction can be coupled to the oxidation of methane migrating upward. Multiple sulfur isotope ratios were measured for porewater sulfate, sulﬁde, elemental sulfur and pyrite from core samples collected from continental shelf (19–96 m water depth) in the Baltic Sea and slope (1098 m water depth) in the Andaman Sea, in order to test if their isotope systematics can be used to trace the two diﬀerent sulfate reduction processes. For shallow shelf sediments ({\textless}43 cm below seaﬂoor), both d34S and D33S values of porewater sulfate increased with increasing depth as a result of organoclastic sulfate reduction (OSR). However, the D33S values of both porewater sulfate and sulﬁde decreased as the d34S values increased downcore at 43–73 cm depth where sulfate reduction was coupled to anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). Pyrite in shelf sediments yielded positive D33S values, reﬂecting D33S of porewater sulﬁde produced by OSR. In contrast, pyrite in slope sediments yielded negative D33S values as low as À0.15‰, as a result of mixing of sulﬁdes derived from OSR and AOM. This is consistent with the slowly migrating sulfate–methane transition (SMT) in slope sediments inferred from sulfur and iron speciation, carbon isotope ratios of carbonates, and magnetic susceptibility data. A stable SMT, focusing AOM at roughly the same depth over the past few millennia, further provides favorable conditions for prolonged pyrite formation with the development of cubic crystals, while the sulfur isotope diﬀerence between bulk pyrite and macroscopic pyrite reﬂects the signiﬁcance of OSR throughout the sediment column. We conclude that minor sulfur isotopes provide a unique proxy that can be applied to diﬀerentiate OSR and AOM and the origin of pyrite in diverse sediments and sedimentary rocks.},\n	language = {en},\n	urldate = {2022-07-10},\n	journal = {Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta},\n	author = {Liu, Jiarui and Pellerin, André and Wang, Jiasheng and Rickard, David and Antler, Gilad and Zhao, Jie and Wang, Zhou and Jørgensen, Bo Barker and Ono, Shuhei},\n	month = jan,\n	year = {2022},\n	pages = {309--330},\n	file = {Liu et al. - 2022 - Multiple sulfur isotopes discriminate organoclasti.pdf:/Users/shuheiono/Zotero/storage/3ICSMF56/Liu et al. - 2022 - Multiple sulfur isotopes discriminate organoclasti.pdf:application/pdf},\n}`,

However, processes such as boiling, magma degassing, fluid-rock interaction and associated redox reactions often obscure the origin of sulfur in the system. The multiple sulfur isotope system is a powerful tool to unravel the processes that affect isotope ratios of sulfur in geothermal systems. Here, we utilized concentrations and multiple isotope ratios (32S/33S/34S/36S) of sulfur from well discharge from geothermal fields at Olkaria, SE Kenya, to investigate the hydrothermal processes and to quantify the sources of sulfur to the system. Fluid sampling temperatures ranged from 157 to 204 ◦C, and the sampled fluids had low Cl concentrations (119 to 1267 ppm Cl) with both liquid water and vapor being present. The concentration of H2S and SO4 in the water phase of the well discharges ranged from 0.53 to 68.0 ppm and from 4.7 to 108 ppm, respectively. In the vapor phase, H2S was the only observed sulfur compound with concentrations between 1.18 and 214 μmol mol− 1. In the water phase, δ34S values for H2S and SO4 ranged from − 1.2 to +4.0‰ and +0.7 to +7.7‰, respectively. The δ34S values of H2S in the vapor phase ranged from +2.0 to +11.3‰. The Δ33S values for H2S in the water and vapor phase were found to be between − 0.017 and +0.021‰ and − 0.042 and +0.008‰, respectively, and for SO4 in the water phase between − 0.024 and + 0.004‰. Sulfur isotopes of H2S in liquid phase were depleted in 34S as a result of depressurization boiling. Sulfur isotope ratios as well as the results of geochemical modelling suggest that sulfide in the fluids dominantly originated from rock leaching where insignificant amounts of sulfur was derived from direct degassing of a magmatic source. Sulfate primarily derived from the oxidation of H2S to SO4 upon fluid ascent to the surface. Based on the geochemical model results and measured sulfur concentrations, the annual natural H2S emission rate at Olkaria was estimated to range from 320 to 510 t H2S yr− 1. These comparatively low sulfur emissions and the lack of significant sulfur sources (e.g., magma or seawater) imply that Olkaria could represent an ideal re-injection site for anthropogenic H2S even if sulfur sequestration rates would be low.},\n	language = {en},\n	urldate = {2022-07-10},\n	journal = {Chemical Geology},\n	author = {Kleine, Barbara I. and Gunnarsson-Robin, Jóhann and Kamunya, Kennedy M. and Ono, Shuhei and Stefánsson, Andri},\n	month = nov,\n	year = {2021},\n	pages = {120446},\n	file = {Kleine et al. - 2021 - Source controls on sulfur abundance and isotope fr.pdf:/Users/shuheiono/Zotero/storage/C9NQBRYW/Kleine et al. - 2021 - Source controls on sulfur abundance and isotope fr.pdf:application/pdf},\n}`,

While sulfur isotope ratio analyses of materials such as bulk rock samples, gases, and sulfide grains are routinely carried out, in-situ an­ alyses of silicate glasses such as those formed in magmatic systems are relatively scarce in the literature. Despite a number of attempts in recent years to analyse sulfur isotope ratios in volcanic and experimental glasses by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), the effects of instrumental mass fractionation (IMF) during analysis remain poorly understood. In this study we use more than 600 sulfur isotope analyses of nine different glasses to characterise the matrix effects that arise during sulfur isotope analysis of glasses by SIMS. Samples were characterised for major element composition, sulfur content, and sulfur isotope ratios by independent methods. Our glasses contain between 500 and 3400 ppm sulfur and cover a wide compositional range, including low-silica basanite, rhyolite, and phonolite, allowing us to investigate composition-dependent IMF. We use SIMS in multi-collection mode with a Faraday cup/ electron multiplier detector configuration to achieve uncertainty of 0.3‰ to 2‰ (2σ) on measured δ34S. At high sulfur content, the analytical error of our SIMS analyses is similar to that of bulk analytical methods, such as gas-source isotope ratio mass spectrometry. We find IMF causes an offset of − 12‰ to +1‰ between bulk sulfur isotope ratios and those measured by SIMS. Instrumental mass fractionation correlates non-linearly with glass sulfur contents and with a multivariate regression model combining glass Al, Na, and K contents. Both ln(S) and Al-Na-K models are capable of predicting IMF with good accuracy: 84\% (ln(S)) and 87\% (Al-Na-K) of our analyses can be reproduced within 2σ combined analytical uncertainty after a correction for composition-dependent IMF is applied. The process driving IMF is challenging to identify. The non-linear correlation between glass S content and IMF in our dataset resembles previously documented correlation between glass H2O abundance and IMF during D/H ratio analyses by SIMS, and could be attributed to changes in 32S− and 34S− ion yields with changing S content and glass composition. However, a clear correlation between S ion yields and S content cannot be identified in our dataset. We speculate that accumulation of alkalis at the SIMS crater floor may be the principal driving force of composition-dependent IMF. Nonetheless, other currently unknown factors could also influence IMF observed during S isotope ratio analyses of glasses by SIMS. Our results demonstrate that the use of multiple, well-characterised standards with a wide compo­ sitional range is required to calibrate SIMS instruments prior to sulfur isotope analyses of unknown silicate glasses. Matrix effects related to glass Al-Na-K contents are of particular importance for felsic systems, where alkali and aluminium contents can vary considerably more than in mafic magmas.},\n	language = {en},\n	urldate = {2022-07-10},\n	journal = {Chemical Geology},\n	author = {Taracsák, Z. and Neave, D.A. and Beaudry, P. and Gunnarsson-Robin, J. and Burgess, R. and Edmonds, M. and Halldórsson, S.A. and Longpré, M-A. and Ono, S. and Ranta, E. and Stefánsson, A. and Turchyn, A.V. and {Eimf} and Hartley, M.E.},\n	month = sep,\n	year = {2021},\n	pages = {120318},\n	file = {Taracsák et al. - 2021 - Instrumental mass fractionation during sulfur isot.pdf:/Users/shuheiono/Zotero/storage/KTZGBPQD/Taracsák et al. - 2021 - Instrumental mass fractionation during sulfur isot.pdf:application/pdf},\n}`,

However, the isotopic (13C/12C and D/H) and isotopologue (13CH3D and 12CH2D2) signatures of microbial methane in natural environments are often different from those in laboratory cultures in which methanogens are typically grown under optimal conditions. Growth phase and hydrogen (H2) concentration have been proposed as factors controlling the isotopic compositions of methane produced via hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, but their effects on the relationship among carbon, hydrogen and doubly-substituted “clumped” isotopologue systems have not been assessed in a quantitative framework. Here we experimentally investigate the bulk (δ13C and δD) and clumped (Δ13CH3D) isotopologue compositions of methane produced by hyperthermophilic hydrogenotrophic (CO2-reducing) methanogens using batch and fed-batch systems at different growth phases and H2 mixing ratios (Methanocaldococcus bathoardescens at 82 or 60 °C and on 80 or 25 \% H2; Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus str. ΔH at 65 °C and on 20, 5 or 1.6 \% H2). We observed a large range (from 18 to 63 ‰) of carbon isotope fractionations, with larger values observed during later growth phase, consistent with previous observations. In contrast, hydrogen isotope fractionations remained relatively constant at –317 ± 25 ‰. Linear growth was observed for experiments with M. bathoardescens, suggesting that dissolution of gaseous H2 into liquid media became the rate limit as cell density increased. Accordingly, the low (and undersaturated) dissolved H2 concentrations can explain the increased carbon isotope fractionations during the later growth phase. The δD and Δ13CH3D values indicated departure from equilibrium throughout experiments. As the cell density increased and dissolved H2 decreased, Δ13CH3D decreased (further departure from equilibrium), contrary to expectations from previous models. Our isotopologue flow network model reproduced the observed trends when the last H-addition step is less reversible relative to the first three H-addition steps (up to CH3-CoM). In this differential reversibility model, carbon, hydrogen and clumped isotopologue fractionations are largely controlled by the reversibility of the first three H-addition steps under high H2 concentrations; the last H-addition step becomes important under low H2.

Icelandic basalts present ideal material to examine the oldest known terrestrial mantle reservoir, accessed through a deep-rooted mantle plume, but their multiple sulfur isotope systematics have not been explored previously. Here, we present new sulfur concentration (30–1570 ppm) and isotope data (δ34S = −2.5 to +3.8‰ and Δ33S = −0.045 to +0.016‰; vs. Canyon Diablo Troilite) from a sample suite (n = 62) focused on subglacially erupted basaltic glasses obtained from Iceland's neovolcanic zones. Using these data along with trace element systematics to account for the effects of magmatic processes (degassing and immiscible sulfide melt formation) on δ34S, we show that primitive (MgO {\textgreater} 6 wt.\%), least degassed glasses accurately record the δ34S signatures of their mantle sources. Compared to the depleted MORB source mantle (DMM; δ34S = −1.3±0.3‰), the Iceland mantle is shown to have a greater range of δ34S values between −2.5 and −0.1\%. Similarly, Icelandic basalts are characterized by more variable and negatively shifted Δ33S values (−0.035 to +0.013‰) relative to DMM (0.004±006‰). Negative δ34S-Δ33S signatures are most prominent in basalts from the Snæfellsnes Volcanic Zone and the Kverkfjöll volcanic system, which also have the lowest, most MORB-like 3He/4He (8–9 R/RA, where RA is the 3He/4He of air) and the highest Ba/La (up to 12) in Iceland. We propose that subduction fluid-enriched, mantle wedge type material, possibly present in the North Atlantic upper mantle, constitutes a low-δ34S-Δ33S component in the Icelandic mantle. This suggests that volatile heterogeneity in Iceland, and potentially at other OIBs, may originate not only from diverse plume-associated mantle components, but also from a heterogeneous ambient upper mantle. By contrast, a set of samples with high 3He/4He (up to 25.9 R/RA) and negative μ182W anomalies define an ancient lower mantle reservoir with a near-chondritic Δ33S and δ34S signature of ∼0‰. The difference between DMM and the high high-3He/4He mantle may reflect separate conditions during core-mantle differentiation, or a previously unidentified flux of sulfur from the core to the high-3He/4He reservoir.},\n	language = {en},\n	urldate = {2022-09-12},\n	journal = {Earth and Planetary Science Letters},\n	author = {Ranta, Eemu and Gunnarsson-Robin, Jóhann and Halldórsson, Sæmundur A. and Ono, Shuhei and Izon, Gareth and Jackson, Matthew G. and Reekie, Callum D.

Reykjavik Energy is currently undertaking a pilot project at Hellisheidi power plant, SW Iceland, where H2S is injected together with wastewater to be sequestered in the geothermal reservoir. Multiple sulfur isotope ratios (δ34S and Δ33S) of injection and reservoir fluids were measured as a potential tracer for subsurface sulfide sequestration processes. The values for δ34S and Δ33S in the injected H2S-fluid and wastewater and reservoir geothermal fluids at Hellisheidi were +10.6‰ and +0.047‰, −2.86‰ and −0.005‰ and −2.5 to +0.9‰ and −0.031 and −0.001‰, respectively. Our geochemical and isotope modeling reveals that upon sulfide mineralization the δ34S value of the fluids in the production wells are expected to become lower due to pyrite precipitation, while the value of Δ33S is expected to be conservative upon mineralization and degassing. It follows sulfur sequestration and mixing process can be monitored by the triple sulfur (32S, 33S, 34S) isotope systematics. The total H2S emissions at Hellisheidi are ˜16 kt per year. Given the size of the geothermal reservoir and the expected production time span of the power plant of about 100–300 years, H2S sequestration in the geothermal reservoir is expected to be a sustainable solution for the reduction of power plant emissions.

Given its origin in oxygen-free photochemistry, mass-independent sulfur isotope fractionation (S-MIF) is widely accepted as a geochemical fingerprint of an anoxic atmosphere. Nevertheless, S-MIF recycling through oxidative sulfide weathering—commonly termed the crustal memory effect (CME)—potentially decouples the multiple sulfur isotope (MSI) record from coeval atmospheric chemistry. Herein, however, after accounting for unrecognised temporal and spatial biases within the Archaean–early-Palaeoproterozoic MSI record, we demonstrate that the global expression of the CME is barely resolvable; thereby validating S-MIF as a tracer of contemporaneous atmospheric chemistry during Earth’s incipient oxygenation. Next, utilising statistical approaches, supported by new MSI data, we show that the reconciliation of adjacent, yet seemingly discrepant, South African MSI records requires that the rare instances of post-2.3-billion-year-old S-MIF are stratigraphically restricted. Accepting others’ primary photochemical interpretation, our approach demands that these implied atmospheric dynamics were ephemeral, operating on sub-hundred-thousand-year timescales.

Identifying the source of methane allows us to assess the potential of natural gas reservoirs and the limits of subsurface microbial life. However, such assessments are complicated by the burial and transport of methane, which can produce mixtures from multiple sources. We measured the abundances of stable isotopes (13C/12C and D/H), clumped isotopologue 13CH3D, and n-alkanes (C1/C2+3, methane over ethane plus propane) for gas samples collected by mud-logging to investigate how 13CH3D can be used to constrain sources of methane. Two kilometer-scale depth profiles representing the transition between microbial and thermal methanogenic zones were analyzed from the northeastern Gulf of Mexico and the western Black Sea. We found that Δ13CH3D values of methane do not follow conservative two-component mixing between shallow microbial methane and deep thermogenic methane transported by advection. Rather, methane isotopologues indicate re-equilibration along geothermal gradients following burial, which continues up to apparent temperatures of 100 ± 15 ◦C. The reequilibration is likely microbially catalyzed, although this apparent temperature is ca. 20 ◦C higher than the putative upper-temperature limit of microbial methanogenesis in marine sediments. Above 150 ◦C, methane isotopologues are expected to equilibrate along geothermal gradients because the rate of abiotic D/H exchange becomes comparable to that of temperature increase with burial.

Dissolved sulﬁde (S-II) and sulfate (SVI) predominated in the water phase with trace concentrations of thiosulfate (S2O23À) whereas sulﬁde (S-II) was the only species observed in the vapor phase. The reconstructed sulfur isotope ratios of the reservoir ﬂuids based on samples collected at surface from two-phase and vapor only well discharges indicated that d34S and D33S of sulﬁde in the reservoir ﬂuid ranged from À1.5 to +1.1\& and À0.001 to À0.017\&, respectively, whereas d34S and D33S of sulfate were signiﬁcantly diﬀerent and ranged from +3.4 to +13.4\& and 0.000 to À0.036\&, respectively.

Clumped isotopologues of methane (e.g., Δ13CH3D) have emerged as a proxy for constraining methane formation temperatures in sedimentary basins. However, unrealistically high apparent temperatures and microbial cycling of methane necessitate further investigation into how the generation and biodegradation of hydrocarbons may modify methane clumped iso­ topologue signatures. This study analyzed and modeled the clumped isotopologues of methane, in addition to traditional gas isotopes, to provide new insights into the origin, thermal maturity, migration, and biodegradation histories of hydrocarbons in the Paradox Basin in the Colorado Plateau. The basin was deeply buried in the geologic past and has been recently incised, leading to rapid denudation, enhanced meteoric circulation, and microbial activity. δ13CCH4 and CH4/ΣC2+ ratios suggest that most natural gases in various reservoirs throughout the basin are thermogenic in origin with variable thermal maturities. However, signatures suggestive of anaerobic oxidation of ethane and propane, and secondary microbial methane generation, exist. In the north­ eastern part of the basin, Δ13CH3D values in reservoirs above and below the Paradox Formation source rocks are consistent with thermodynamic equilibrium, indicating that the thermally mature hydrocarbons equilibrated at ≥160 ◦C during maximum burial over 30–80 Ma. Disequilibrium Δ13CH3D values of natural gas in Paradox Formation reservoirs along the southwestern margin of the basin suggest the presence of low-maturity hydro­ carbons consistent with the region’s shallower burial history. Models of Δ13CH3D values based on the exchange rate of hydrogen isotopes between methane and water and the basin thermal history support that meteoric recharge and microbial activity, following incision/denudation over the past few million years, promoted anaerobic oxidation of hydrocarbons (particularly ethane and propane), biodegradation of crude oil, and gen­ eration of secondary microbial methane in shallow reservoirs.},\n	language = {en},\n	urldate = {2023-11-12},\n	journal = {Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta},\n	author = {Kim, Ji-Hyun and Martini, Anna M. and Ono, Shuhei and Lalk, Ellen and Ferguson, Grant and McIntosh, Jennifer C.},\n	month = nov,\n	year = {2023},\n	pages = {133--151},\n	file = {Kim et al. - 2023 - Clumped and conventional isotopes of natural gas r.pdf:/Users/shuheiono/Zotero/storage/RRJJLFLM/Kim et al. - 2023 - Clumped and conventional isotopes of natural gas r.pdf:application/pdf},\n}`,

Sulfur is one of the most abundant volatile elements present in magmas and volcanic fluids from the La Fossa crater, where it mostly occurs as SO\n              2\n              and H\n              2\n              S at variable relative concentrations depending on oxygen fugacity and temperature. The isotope composition and the chemical ratio of sulfur species depict a complex hydrothermal-magmatic system. In addition, we utilize the installed SO\n              2\n              monitoring network that measures the total outgassing of SO\n              2\n              with the UV-scanning DOAS technique. The SO\n              2\n              fluxes from the La Fossa crater fumaroles, coupled with the SO\n              2\n              /CO\n              2\n              and SO\n              2\n              /H\n              2\n              O ratios, were measured to evaluate the total mass of fluids emitted by the shallow plumbing system and its relationship with the status of volcanic activity. Combining the whole chemical composition of fumaroles analyzed with a discrete, direct sampling of high-temperature fumaroles located on the crater summit, the output of discharged water vapor has been estimated (5,768 t·d\n              −1\n              ). On the basis of the water output, we estimated the total thermal energy dissipated by the crater during the last enhanced degassing activity (167 MW). This strong and sharp increase in energy observed during the current crisis confirms the long-growing trend in terms of mass and energy recorded in recent decades, which has brought the surface system of Vulcano Island to a critical level that has never been recorded since the last eruptive event of 1888–91.},\n	language = {en},\n	urldate = {2023-11-12},\n	journal = {Frontiers in Earth Science},\n	author = {Inguaggiato, Salvatore and Liotta, Marcello and Rouwet, Dmitri and Tassi, Franco and Vita, Fabio and Schiavo, Benedetto and Ono, Shuhei and Keller, Nicole Simone},\n	month = aug,\n	year = {2023},\n	pages = {1197796},\n	file = {Inguaggiato et al. - 2023 - Sulfur origin and flux variations in fumarolic flu.pdf:/Users/shuheiono/Zotero/storage/5LB6YPFB/Inguaggiato et al. - 2023 - Sulfur origin and flux variations in fumarolic flu.pdf:application/pdf},\n}`,

Herein, we investigate these competing models through the study of the Ear­ ly–Middle Jurassic Talkeetna Arc section exposed in the Chugach Mountains, south-central Alaska, reporting the sulfur isotope systematics of rocks spanning a depth transect that extends from the upper mantle ({\textasciitilde}0.9–1.2 GPa, {\textasciitilde}30–35 km) up into the mid-crust ({\textasciitilde}0.2–0.5 GPa, {\textasciitilde}5–15 km). Marked by an increase in δ34S values from − 1.28 to +5.61‰, these data reveal a significant isotope effect associated with melt differentiation, with 32S being preferentially sequestered from primitive basaltic melts into ultramafic and mafic cumulates, yielding progres­ sively more evolved melts enriched in 34S. Leveraging a quantitative petrological model that constrains the liquid line of descent and sulfide saturation as a function of sulfur content, oxygen fugacity, pressure and temperature, we then demonstrate that, in the presence of dissolved oxidized sulfur species, the saturation of immiscible magmatic sulfides is capable of generating the observed sulfur isotope fractionation. While fluid saturation is unlikely to occur at lower crustal depths, ascending melts will almost certainly experience fluid saturation and degassing. As a result, sulfide immiscibility and magma degassing are not mutually exclusive and may, instead, represent complementary processes that combine to explain the observed range of positive δ34S compositions. In Talkeetna, crustal assimilation is unlikely to have played a role to increase δ34S values as there was little to no assimilation of pre-existing oceanic crust containing seawater sulfate during the formation of the Talkeetna Arc section. Furthermore, our model suggests that primitive melt in isotopic equilibrium with the most primitive ultramafic cumulates have mantle-like δ34S values between {\textasciitilde}0 and +1.1‰, which suggest limited input of 34Senriched slab-derived sulfur into the sub-arc mantle. Collectively, these findings emphasize that mantle-like δ34S values for primitive arc melt may be common, while revealing the underappreciated importance of deep crustal crystallization of immiscible magmatic sulfides to generate positive δ34S compositions in erupted arc magmas.},\n	language = {en},\n	urldate = {2023-11-12},\n	journal = {Chemical Geology},\n	author = {Rezeau, H. and Jagoutz, O. and Beaudry, P. and Izon, G. and Kelemen, P. and Ono, S.},\n	month = mar,\n	year = {2023},\n	pages = {121325},\n	file = {Rezeau et al. - 2023 - The role of immiscible sulfides for sulfur isotope.pdf:/Users/shuheiono/Zotero/storage/WN2AP8TE/Rezeau et al. - 2023 - The role of immiscible sulfides for sulfur isotope.pdf:application/pdf},\n}`,

We report new CO2 and N2 isotope and relative abundance data in exceptionally gas-rich mantle peridotite and pyroxenite xenoliths from nine localities throughout the eastern branch of the East African Rift System (EARS). Importantly for our study, the xenolith localities straddle the transition between continental and oceanic lithosphere. In addition, we report major and trace element contents together with oxygen isotopes on host crystals and bulk multiple sulfur isotope data on select pyroxene crystals from the same xenolith suite. These new data are interpreted alongside previously published He, Ne and Ar isotope and relative abundance data. Pyroxenite xenoliths formed from the infiltration and crystallization of mafic melts in the lithospheric mantle. This was followed by fluids fracturing through the pyroxenites leaving gas-rich fluid inclusions. The elemental and isotope systematics of the fluid inclusion-hosted volatile species (He, Ar, N, CO2) within the mantle xenoliths are consistent with the enrichment of the EARS SCLM by CO2-rich mantle fluids from subducted carbonate-rich material. Such CO2 enrichments (CO2/3He {\textgreater} 7 × 109, δ13C {\textasciitilde}0‰) are also associated with positive δ15N values (as high as +3.4‰), reinforcing the link between the metasomatic fluids and subduction of hydrothermally altered oceanic crust. Recycled signatures are also consistent with oxygen and sulfur isotope compositions of host crystals, which are distinct from compositions typical for the depleted upper MORB-source mantle. The occurrence of recycled volatile signatures in the EARS SCLM is widespread and must therefore be associated with a large-scale mantle process currently supplying material to EARS magmas. Notably, mantle xenoliths with high 3He/4He from the Ethiopian Rift are also associated with δ15N and δ13C values similar to the composition of sediments.

The relative composition of its isotopologues (12CH4, 13CH4, 12CH3D and 13CH3D) is used to infer its sources and sinks. The anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) is an important methane sink reaction carried out by consortia of anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) and partner bacteria in the presence of methane and sulfate. We investigated the methane isotopologue fractionations during AOM in experiments with cultures of ANME-1 archaea and partner bacteria obtained from hydrothermally heated gas-rich sediments of the Guaymas Basin. During partial methane consumption in four sets of experiments, residual methane became enriched in 13CH4 and 12CH3D, following kinetic fractionations from 11.1 to 18.3‰ and from 117 to 180‰, respectively. Results from one set of experiments with D-depleted medium water (dD = –200‰, whereas the control was –55‰) suggest the potential reversibility during the methane activation step, which would contribute to equilibrium as opposed to kinetic fractionations. The value of D13CH3D (the abundance of 13CH3D with respect to that expected from stochastic distribution) increased toward and beyond (up to 8.4‰) the value expected for isotopologue equilibrium (5.3‰ at 37 °C). The kinetic clumped isotopologue fractionation (diﬀerence between 13CH3D/12CH3D and 13CH4/12CH4 fractionations) of 4.8 to 12.8‰ is in contrast with our previous observation of little to no clumped isotopologue eﬀect during aerobic methane oxidation.

A series of photochemical experiments were performed to examine the excitation band dependence of S-MIF during the photochemistry of SO 2 under broadband light sources (a xenon arc lamp and a deuterium arc lamp). Optical filters (200±35nm bandpass and 250nm longpass filters) were used to separately access two different excitation bands of SO 2 in the 190-220nm and the 250-330nm absorption regions, respectively. UV irradiation of SO 2 in the 190-220nm and 250-330nm regions both produced elemental sulfur (S 0) and sulfur trioxide (SO 3) as end products but yielded very different sulfur isotope signatures. The elemental sulfur products from direct photolysis in the 190-220nm region were characterized by high δ 34S values (154.7-212.0‰), modest Δ 33S anomalies of 21±3‰, and relatively constant 33λ (=ln(δ 33S+1)/ln(δ 34S+1)) values of 0.64±0.3, all with respect to the initial SO 2. Photoexcitation in the 250-330nm region produced elemental sulfur with δ 34S values of 7.7-29.1‰ and Δ 33S values of 15.0±1.6‰. In both excitation regions, the SO 3 products were mass dependently fractionated relative to the SO 2 reservoir. The two different absorption regions produced contrasting Δ 36S/Δ 33S signatures in the elemental sulfur products, with Δ 36S/Δ 33S=-1.9±0.3 and 0.64±0.3 for the 190-220nm and 250-330nm bands, respectively. Our results provide several critical constraints on the origin of the S-MIF signatures observed in modern stratospheric aerosols and in the Archean geological record. A lack of S-MIF in the sulfate product and positive Δ 36S/Δ 33S ratios for the elemental sulfur from SO 2 photo-oxidation demonstrate that photoexcitation in the 250-330nm region is not a likely source for the S-MIF observed in modern stratospheric aerosols. Large δ 34S fractionation, 33λ values, and Δ 36S/Δ 33S ratios observed for the 190-220nm band are qualitatively consistent with predictions from synthetic isotopologue-specific cross sections. These isotope patterns, however, are not compatible with the Archean rock record.

The S-MIF signatures are thought to be associated with stratospheric photochemistry following stratospheric volcanic eruptions, but the exact mechanism responsible for the production and preservation of these signatures is debated. In order to identify the origin and the mechanism of preservation for these signatures, a series of laboratory photochemical experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of temperature and added O2 on the S-MIF produced by two absorption band systems of SO2: photolysis in the 190 to 220 nm region and photoexcitation in the 250 to 350 nm region. The SO2 photolysis (SO2 + hν → SO + O) experiments showed S-MIF signals with large 34S/34S fractionations, which increases with decreasing temperature. The overall S-MIF pattern observed for photolysis experiments, including high 34S/34S fractionations, positive mass-independent anomalies in 33S, and negative anomalies in 36S, is consistent with a major contribution from optical isotopologue screening effects and data for stratospheric sulfate aerosols. In contrast, SO2 photoexcitation produced products with positive S-MIF anomalies in both 33S and 36S, which is different from stratospheric sulfate aerosols. SO2 photolysis in the presence of O2 produced SO3 with S-MIF signals, suggesting the transfer of the S-MIF anomalies from SO to SO3 by the SO + O2 + M → SO3 + M reaction. This is supported with energy calculations of stationary points on the SO3 potential energy surfaces, which indicate that this reaction occurs slowly on a single adiabatic surface, but that it can occur more rapidly through intersystem crossing. Based on our experimental results, we estimate a termolecular rate constant on the order of 10-37 cm6 molecule-2 s-1. This rate can explain the preservation of mass independent isotope signatures in stratospheric sulfate aerosols and provides a minor, but important, oxidation pathway for stratospheric SO2. The production and preservation of S-MIF signals requires a high SO2 column density to allow for optical isotopologue screening effects to occur and to generate a large enough signature that it can be preserved. In addition, the SO2 plume must reach an altitude of around 20 to 25 km, where SO2 photolysis becomes a dominant process.

These unique isotope signatures signify the breakdown of the traditional theory of isotope fractionation, but the physical chemistry of these isotope effects remains poorly understood.

The observed MIF signature differs considerably from that predicted by isotopologue-specific absorption cross-sections of SO2 and is insensitive to the wavelength region of excitation (above or below 300 nm), suggesting that the MIF originates not from the initial excitation of SO2 to the singlet states but from an isotope selective spin-orbit interaction between the singlet ({\textasciitilde}A1A2/ {\textasciitilde}B1B1) and triplet ({\textasciitilde}a3B1) manifolds.

For doubly substituted methane, 13CH3D, the observed kinetic isotope effects closely follow the product of the kinetic isotope effects for the 13C and deuterium substituted species (i.e., 13,2KIE = 13KIE × 2KIE). The deviation from this relationship is 0.3‰ ± 1.2‰ and 3.5‰ ± 0.7‰ for OH and Cl oxidation, respectively. This is consistent with model calculations performed using quantum chemistry and transition state theory. The OH and Cl reactions enrich the residual methane in the clumped isotopologue in open system reactions. In a closed system, however, this effect is overtaken by the large D/H isotope effect, which causes the residual methane to become anti-clumped relative to the initial methane. Based on these results, we demonstrate that oxidation of methane by OH, the predominant oxidant for tropospheric methane, will only have a minor (∼0.3‰) impact on the clumped isotope signature (Δ13CH3D, measured as a deviation from a stochastic distribution of isotopes) of tropospheric methane. This paper shows that Δ13CH3D will provide constraints on methane source strengths, and predicts that Δ12CH2D2 can provide information on methane sink strengths.},\n	journal = {Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta},\n	author = {Whitehill, Andrew R. and Joelsson, Lars Magnus T. and Schmidt, Johan A. and Wang, David T. and Johnson, Matthew S. and Ono, Shuhei},\n	year = {2017},\n	note = {Publisher: Elsevier Ltd},\n	keywords = {Methane, Clumped isotopes, Kinetic isotope effect},\n	pages = {307--325},\n	file = {Whitehill et al. - 2017 - Clumped isotope effects during OH and Cl oxidation.pdf:/Users/shuheiono/Zotero/storage/2NDHFFMQ/Whitehill et al. - 2017 - Clumped isotope effects during OH and Cl oxidation.pdf:application/pdf},\n}`,

Multiple hypotheses have been proposed for the origin(s) of this methane, ranging from synthesis via reduction of aqueous inorganic carbon (∑CO2) during active fluid circulation to leaching of methane-rich fluid inclusions from plutonic rocks of the oceanic crust. To further resolve the process(es) responsible for methane generation in these systems, we determined the relative abundances of several methane isotopologues (including 13CH3D, a “clumped” isotopologue containing two rare isotope substitutions) in hot-spring source fluids sampled from four geochemically-distinct hydrothermal vent fields (Rainbow, Von Damm, Lost City, and Lucky Strike).

Combined with very similar bulk stable isotope ratios (13C/12C and D/H) of methane across the suite of hydrothermal fluids, all available geochemical and isotopic data suggest a common mechanism of methane generation at depth that is disconnected from active fluid circulation. Attainment of equilibrium amongst methane isotopologues at temperatures of ca. 270–360 °C is compatible with the thermodynamically-favorable reduction of CO2 to CH4 at temperatures at or below ca. 400 °C under redox conditions characterizing intrusive rocks derived from sub-ridge melts. Collectively, the observations support a model where methane-rich aqueous fluids, known to be trapped in rocks of the oceanic lithosphere, are liberated from host rocks during hydrothermal circulation and perhaps represent the major source of methane venting with thermal waters at unsedimented hydrothermal fields.

Our results indicate that observed isotopic variations are mainly controlled by mixing of mass-dependently (MD) and non-mass-dependently fractionated (non-MD) sulfur reservoirs. Based on the quadruple sulfur isotope systematics (δ34S–Δ33S–Δ36S) for these minerals, four end-member sulfur reservoirs have been recognized: (1) non-MD sulfate (δ34S = −5 ± 2‰; Δ33S = −3 ± 1‰); (2) MD sulfate (δ34S = +10 ± 3‰); (3) non-MD sulfur (δ34S {\textgreater} +6‰; Δ33S {\textgreater} +4‰); and (4) igneous MD sulfur (δ34S = Δ33S = 0‰). The first and third components show a clear non-MD signatures, thus probably represent sulfate and sulfur aerosol inputs. The MD sulfate component (2) is enriched in 34S (+10 ± 3‰) and may have originated from microbial and/or abiotic disproportionation of volcanic S or SO2. Our results reconfirm that the Dresser barites contain small amounts of pyrite depleted in 34S by 15–22‰ relative to the host barite. These barite–pyrite pairs exhibit a mass-dependent relationship of δ33S/δ34S with slope less than 0.512, which is consistent with that expected for microbial sulfate reduction and is significantly different from that of equilibrium fractionation (0.515). The barite–pyrite pairs also show up to 1‰ difference in Δ36S values and steep Δ36S/Δ33S slopes, which deviate from the main Archean array (Δ36S/Δ33S = −0.9) and are comparable to isotope effects exhibited by sulfate reducing microbes (Δ36S/Δ33S = −5 to −11).

This study investigates the relationship between the availability of iron and reduced nitrogen and the magnitude of S-isotope fractionation during MSR by a marine sulfate-reducing bacterium, DMSS-1, a Desulfovibrio species, isolated from salt marsh in Cape Cod, MA. Submicromolar levels of iron increase sulfur isotope fractionation by about 50\% relative to iron-replete cultures of DMSS-1.

We tested mutant strains lacking one or two periplasmic (Hyd, Hyn-1, Hyn-2, and Hys) or cytoplasmic hydrogenases (Ech and CooL), and a mutant lacking type I tetraheme cytochrome (TpI-c3). In batch culture, wild-type D. vulgaris and its hydrogenase mutants had comparable growth kinetics and produced the same sulfur isotope effects.

The magnitude of sulfur isotope fractionation in the CycA deletionstrain, thus, increased due to the disrupted coupling of the carbon oxidation and sulfate reduction pathways. In continuous culture, wild-type D. vulgaris and the CycA mutant produced similar sulfur isotope effects, underscoring the influence of environmental conditions on the relative contribution of hydrogen cycling to the electron transport.

Despite the comparable carbon isotope anomalies, however, a major extinction has been reported only for the Kellwasser Events, while the punctata Event is marked by low extinction intensity. This study presents multiple sulfur isotope records of carbonate-associated sulfate (CAS) and pyrite from Late Devonian sections in the Great Basin, USA, in order to document changes in the coupled (or decoupled) geochemical cycles of carbon and sulfur during the punctata and Upper Kellwasser events. A positive sulfur isotope shift in both CAS and pyrite accompanies the onset of the punctata Event, but to a larger extent in the latter. As a result, the sulfur isotope offset between CAS and pyrite (δ34SCAS-py) dropped to less than 10‰. In the middle of the punctata Event, a sharp negative δ34SCAS excursion and negative δ34SCAS-py values coincide with the Alamo impact. Unlike the rapid δ34Spy and δ34SCAS oscillations associated with the punctata Event, the Upper Kellwasser was a period of relative stability, except for a brief δ34SCAS drop before the event. Paired sulfur isotope data, aided by a simple box model, suggest that the geochemical cycle of sulfur may have been partly responsible for the contrasting biological responses that define these events. High stratigraphic δ34Spy and δ34SCAS variability, coupled with strong reservoir effect, demonstrates a relatively small oceanic sulfate pool existed during the punctata Event. Further, the Alamo impact likely triggered the rapid oxidation of microbially-produced sulfide within this event. The expansion of sulfidic bottom water thus may have been impeded during the punctata Event. In contrast, the lack of a positive shift in δ34SCAS and sizable δ34SCAS-py values ({\textgreater}15‰) throughout the Upper Kellwasser Event imply higher relative sulfate levels.

In this study, we investigate how the coupling of carbon and sulfur metabolisms in batch and continuous cultures of a recently isolated marine sulfate reducing bacterium DMSS-1, a Desulfovibrio sp., influences the fractionation of sulfur isotopes. DMSS-1 grown in batch culture on seven different electron donors (ethanol, glycerol, fructose, glucose, lactate, malate and pyruvate) fractionates 34S/32S ratio from 6‰ to 44‰, demonstrating that the fractionations by an actively growing culture of a single incomplete oxidizing sulfate reducing microbe can span almost the entire range of previously reported values in defined cultures. The magnitude of isotope effect correlates well with cell specific sulfate reduction rates (from 0.7 to 26.1fmol/cell/day). DMSS-1 grown on lactate in continuous culture produces a larger isotope effect (21-37‰) than the lactate-grown batch culture (6‰), indicating that the isotope effect also depends on the supply rate of the electron donor and microbial growth rate. The largest isotope effect in continuous culture is accompanied by measurable changes in cell length and cellular yield that suggest starvation. The use of multiple sulfur isotopes in the model of metabolic fluxes of sulfur shows that the loss of sulfate from the cell and the intracellular reoxidation of reduced sulfur species contribute to the increase in isotope effects in a correlated manner. Isotope fractionations produced during sulfate reduction in the pure culture of DMSS-1 expand the previously reported range of triple sulfur isotope effects (32S, 33S, and 34S) by marine sulfate reducing bacteria, implying that microbial sulfur disproportionation may have a smaller 33S isotopic fingerprint than previously thought. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},\n	number = {15},\n	journal = {Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta},\n	author = {Sim, Min Sub and Ono, Shuhei and Donovan, Katie and Templer, Stefanie P. and Bosak, Tanja},\n	year = {2011},\n	pages = {4244--4259},\n	file = {Sim et al. - 2011 - Effect of electron donors on the fractionation of .pdf:/Users/shuheiono/Zotero/storage/JID5I2HA/Sim et al. - 2011 - Effect of electron donors on the fractionation of .pdf:application/pdf},\n}`,

Alteration of the oceanic crust commonly yields secondary pyrite that is depleted in 34S relative to igneous sulfides. Although these 34S depleted sulfur isotope ratios may point to signatures of biological fractionation, previous interpretations of sulfur isotope fractionation in altered volcanic rocks have relied on abiotic fractionation processes between intermediate sulfur species formed during basalt alteration. Here, we report results for multiple S-isotope (32S, 33S, 34S) compositions of altered basalts at ODP Site 801 in the western Pacific and provide evidence for microbial sulfate reduction within the volcanic oceanic crust. In-situ ion-microprobe analyses of secondary pyrite in basement rocks show a large range of δ34S values, between - 45‰ and 1‰, whereas bulk rock δ34S analyses yield a more restricted range of - 15.8 to 0.9‰. These low and variable δ34S values, together with bulk rock S concentrations ranging from 0.02\% up to 1.28\% are consistent with loss of magmatic primary mono-sulfide and addition of secondary sulfide via microbial sulfate reduction. High-precision multiple sulfur-isotope (32S/33S/34S) analyses suggest that secondary sulfides exhibit mass-dependent equilibrium fractionation relative to seawater sulfate in both δ33S and δ34S values. These relationships are explained by bacterial sulfate reduction proceeding at very low metabolic rates. The determination of the S-isotope composition of bulk altered oceanic crust demonstrates that S-based metabolic activity of subsurface life in oceanic basalt is widespread, and can affect the global S budget at the crust-seawater interface. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Characterizing the expected subtle variations in tropospheric N 2O isotopic composition demands high-precision and high-frequency measurements. To enable useful observations of N2O isotopic composition in tropospheric air to reduce N2O source and sink uncertainty, it was necessary to develop a high-precision measurement system with fully automated capabilities for autonomous deployment at remote research stations. METHODS A fully automated pre-concentration system for high-precision measurements of N2O isotopic composition (δ15N β, δ15Nα, δ 18O) in tropospheric air has been developed which combines a custom liquid-cryogen-free cryo-trapping system and gas chromatograph interfaced to a continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) system. A quadrupole mass spectrometer was coupled in parallel to the IRMS system during development to evaluate peak interference. Multi-port inlet and fully-automated capabilities allow streamlined analyses between in situ air inlet, air standards, flask air sample, or other gas source in exactly replicated analysis sequences. RESULTS The system has the highest precision to date for 15N site-specific composition results (δ15Nα ±0.11‰, δ15Nβ ±0.14‰ (1σ)), attributed mostly to uniformity of analytical cycles and particular attention to fluorocarbon interference noted for 15N site-specific measurements by IRMS. Air measurements demonstrated the fully automated capacity and performance. CONCLUSIONS The system makes substantial headway in measurement precision, possibly defining the limits of IRMS measurement capabilities in low concentration N2O air samples, with fully automated capabilities to enable high-frequency in situ measurements.

In order to test whether secondary sulfide minerals are consistent with a biogenic source, we apply high precision multiple sulfur isotope analysis to bulk rock sulfide and pyrite isolates from two contrasting types of altered oceanic basement rocks, namely serpentinized peridotites and altered basalts. Samples from two peridotite sites (Iberian Margin and Hess Deep) and from a basalt site on the eastern flank of the Juan de Fuca Ridge yield overlapping δ 34S values ranging from 0‰ to -44‰. In contrast, sulfides in the basalt site are characterized by relatively low Δ 33S values ranging from -0.06‰ to 0.04‰, compared to those from peridotite sites (0.00‰ to 0.16‰). The observed Δ 33S signal is significant considering the analytical precision of 0.014‰ (2σ). We present a batch reaction model that uses observed δ 34S and Δ 33S relationships to quantify the effect of closed system processes and constrain the isotope enrichment factor intrinsic to sulfate reduction. The estimated enrichment factors as large as 61‰ and 53‰, for peridotite and basalt sites respectively, suggest the involvement of microbial sulfate reduction. The relatively high Δ 33S values in the peridotite sites are due to sulfate reduction in a closed system environment, whereas negative Δ 33S values in the basalt site reflect open system sulfate reduction. A larger extent of sulfate reduction during alteration of peridotite to serpentinite is consistent with its higher H 2 production capacity compared to basalt alteration, and further supports in-situ microbial sulfate reduction coupled with H 2 production during serpentinization reactions. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},\n	journal = {Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta},\n	author = {Ono, Shuhei and Keller, Nicole S. and Rouxel, Olivier and Alt, Jeffrey C.},\n	month = jun,\n	year = {2012},\n	pages = {323--340},\n}`,

Together with textural observation by SEM, Pb isotope analyses and chemical compositions of brannerite and uranothorite, our data revealed a protracted uranium remobilization history for the uranium deposits in the Elliot Lake district.All grains of uraninite examined show consistently high Th contents, supporting detrital origin of uraninite derived from pegmatitic rocks. The unimodal distribution of Th concentration of uraninite excludes the possibility that uraninite formed by multiple pathways, where some grains are detrital and some are later diagenetic/hydrothermal in origin. The measured uraninite grains yield U-Pb discordia age of 1.8. Ga, which is much younger than the depositional age of the host Huronian Basin (2.45 to 2.2. Ga). This age closely corresponds with the age of peak metamorphism in the Huronian Basin, suggesting that all uraninite grains completely lost its Pb during this time.The least texturally and chemically altered grains of uraninite yield δ18O-SMOW values of -10 to -22 ‰. This range of δ18O value is lower than that expected for uraninite from granitic/pegmatitic rocks by 10 ‰. It is concluded that the oxygen isotope ratios of uraninite is completely reset during the peak metamorphism and/or by interaction with recent meteoric water. The δ18O of uraninite, however, do not show systematic variation with Th/U, Pb/U and 207Pb/206Pb ratios, indicating uraninite exchanged its O isotopes without much disturbance in its chemical composition.Among the various geochemical signatures in uraninite, high Th content is the only original signature preserved since detrital deposition of uraninite.

Measured Δ33S (≈ δ33S-0.515δ34S) values range between -2.3 and +8.5‰ with no apparent meter-scale stratigraphic trend for 70 m section. It was found that early diagenetic pyrites occur in two texturally and isotopically distinct populations such that bulk rock isotope data would reflect mixing of these two sulfur pools. Nodular and layered pyrite yield mostly negative (down to -2.3‰) and relatively constant Δ33S values over a few tens of cm scale. Disseminated pyrites, in contrast, yield positive (0.0-8.5‰) Δ33S values that are heterogeneous in sub-cm scales. The former pyrite sulfur was likely derived from seawater sulfate through microbial sulfate reduction, and the latter preferentially sampled aqueous H2S-S0 reservoirs in late Archean oceans. Relatively constant Δ33S values for layered pyrite suggest Archean sulfate reservoirs had residence times of a few million years.

Conventional sulfur isotope studies, however, are inconclusive about the mass-balance between the two sources because 34S/32S ratios of vent fluid H2S and chimney sulfide minerals may reflect not only the mixing ratio but also isotope exchange between sulfate and sulfide. Here, we show that high-precision analysis of S-33 can provide a unique constraint because isotope mixing and isotope exchange result in different Δ33S (≡δ33S-0.515 δ34S) values of up to 0.04‰ even if δ34S values are identical. Detection of such small Δ33S differences is technically feasible by using the SF6 dual-inlet mass-spectrometry protocol that has been improved to achieve a precision as good as 0.006‰ (2σ). Sulfide minerals (marcasite, pyrite, chalcopyrite, and sphalerite) and vent H2S collected from four active seafloor hydrothermal vent sites, East Pacific Rise (EPR) 9-10°N, 13°N, and 21°S and Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) 37°N yield Δ33S values ranging from -0.002 to 0.033 and δ34S from -0.5‰ to 5.3‰. The combined δ34S and Δ33S systematics reveal that 73 to 89\% of vent sulfides are derived from leaching from basaltic sulfide and only 11 to 27\% from seawater-derived sulfate. Pyrite from EPR 13°N and marcasite from MAR 37°N are in isotope disequilibrium not only in δ34S but also in Δ33S with respect to associated sphalerite and chalcopyrite, suggesting non-equilibrium sulfur isotope exchange between seawater sulfate and sulfide during pyrite precipitation. Seafloor hydrothermal vent sulfides are characterized by low Δ33S values compared with biogenic sulfides, suggesting little or no contribution of sulfide from microbial sulfate reduction into hydrothermal sulfides at sediment-free mid-oceanic ridge systems.

These linear trends are found in both shallow water and deepwater facies but are characteristic to rocks with high-iron content suggesting these may reflect isotopic compositions of aqueous sulfide-elemental sulfur reservoirs in the Neoarchean oceans. Data that deviate from this linear array are interpreted as resulting from additional inputs of sulfide from microbial sulfate reduction with or without contribution from sulfur disproportionation. Sulfate-derived sulfur evolved to be either enriched or depleted in 34S depending on the local depositional environment. For example, the Reivilo Formation in core GKF01 is characterized by abundant microbialite textures and shows an isotopic signature of closed system sulfate reduction. Rapid cementation of these carbonate fabrics may have attenuated the supply of sulfate to pore waters resulting in the progressive 34S enrichments during bacterial sulfate reduction below the sediment-water interface. In contrast, signatures of open-system sulfate reduction are associated with slope facies, dominated by granular dolostones, preserved in the upper Nauga Formations in GKF01 and GKP01. The two different sulfur isotope patterns, interpreted to reflect closed versus open-system sulfate reduction are both found in the lower Reivilo Formation in both cores. This lateral variation of isotope signals documents that observed 34S shifts can be controlled locally, and may not have temporal significance. This study demonstrates critical importance of recovering sulfur isotope data from stratigraphically correlated drill cores to evaluate both geographical and temporal shifts of sulfur cycles, and their links to the great oxidation event at the end of the Archean Eon. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Carbon and hydrogen isotope ratios have been used to better constrain the sources of methane but interpretations based on these two parameters alone can often be inconclusive. The precise measurement of a doubly substituted methane isotopologue, 13CH3D, is expected to add a critical new dimension to source signatures by providing the apparent temperature at which methane was formed or thermally equilibrated. We have developed a new method to precisely determine the relative abundance of 13CH3D by using tunable infrared laser direct absorption spectroscopy (TILDAS). The TILDAS instrument houses two continuous wave quantum cascade lasers; one tuned at 8.6 μm to measure 13CH3D, 12CH3D, and 12CH4, and the other at 7.5 μm to measure 13CH4. With the use of an astigmatic Herriott cell with an effective path length of 76 m, a precision of 0.2‰ (2σ) was achieved for the measurement of 13CH3D abundance in ca. 10 mL STP (i.e., 0.42 mmol) pure methane samples. Smaller quantity samples (ca. 0.5 mL STP) can be measured at lower precision. The accuracy of the Δ13CH3D measurement is 0.7‰ (2σ), evaluated by thermally equilibrating methane with a range of δD values. The precision of ±0.2‰ corresponds to uncertainties of ±7 °C at 25 °C and ±20 °C at 200 °C for estimates of apparent equilibrium temperatures.

The Δ33S values (Δ33S ≈ δ33S-0.515 × δ34S) shift from -1.9 to +6.9‰ over a 22-m core section of the lower Mount McRae Shale (∼2.5 Ga). Likewise, sulfide sulfur analyses of the Jeerinah Formation (∼2.7 Ga) yield Δ33S values of -0.1 to +8.1‰ over a 50-m section of core. Despite wide variations in Δ33S and δ34S, these two shale units yield a similar positive correlation between Δ33S and δ34S.

The stratigraphic distribution of δ33S, δ34S, and Δ33S in Western Australia allows us to speculate on the sulfur isotopic composition of Archean sulfur reservoirs and to trace pathways in the Archean sulfur cycle. Our data are explained by a combination of mass-independent fractionation (MIF) in the atmosphere and biological mass-dependent fractionation in the ocean. In the Archean, volcanic, sulfur-bearing gas species were photolysed by solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation in an oxygen-free atmosphere, resulting in MIF of sulfur isotopes. Aerosols of S8 (with Δ33S {\textgreater} 0) and sulfuric acid (with Δ33S {\textless} 0) formed from the products of UV photolysis and carried mass-independently fractionated sulfur into the hydrosphere. The signatures of atmospheric photolysis were preserved by precipitation of pyrite in sediments. Pyrite precipitation was mediated by microbial enzymatic catalysis that superimposed mass-dependent fractionation on mass-independent atmospheric effects.

The model includes lateral and vertical advection as well as vertical diffusion, which are found to be significant components of the seasonal budgets of oxygen, DIC and nitrate. The vertical and seasonal variation of the remineralization rates deduced from the oxygen and DIC distributions are very similar. Both locate the spring-summer community compensation depth at ∼ 85m and the remineralization rate maximum at ∼ 120 m; nitrate-based estimates of these depths are about 40m greater. Remineralization rates based on oxygen, DIC and nitrate all show the seasonal maximum to occur in the late spring, presumably reflecting the decomposition of organic matter formed during the spring bloom. The remineralization rate integrated between 100 and 250 m and between mid-April and mid-December is estimated to be 2.08 ± 0.38 mol O2 m-2, 1.53 ± 0.35 mol Cm-2 and 0.080 ± 0.046 mol Nm-2.

The diversity and ecophysiological role of soil microorganisms that can consume low atmospheric abundances of H2 with high-affinity [NiFe]-hydrogenases is unknown. We expanded the library of atmospheric H2-consuming strains to include four soil Harvard Forest Isolate (HFI) Streptomyces spp., Streptomyces cattleya and Rhodococcus equi by assaying for high-affinity hydrogenase (hhyL) genes and quantifying H2 uptake rates. We find that aerial structures (hyphae and spores) are important for StreptomycesH2 consumption; uptake was not observed in S.griseoflavusTu4000 (deficient in aerial structures) and was reduced by physical disruption of Streptomyces sp. HFI8 aerial structures. H2 consumption depended on the life cycle stage in developmentally distinct actinobacteria: Streptomyces sp. HFI8 (sporulating) and R.equi (non-sporulating, non-filamentous). Strain HFI8 took up H2 only after forming aerial hyphae and sporulating, while R.equi only consumed H2 in the late exponential and stationary phase. These observations suggest that conditions favouring H2 uptake by actinobacteria are associated with energy and nutrient limitation.

Due to its great depth, the Piccard site is an excellent natural system for investigating the influence of extreme pressure on the formation of submarine vent fluids. To investigate the role of rock composition and deep circulation conditions on fluid chemistry, the abundance and isotopic composition of organic, inorganic, and dissolved volatile species in high temperature vent fluids at Piccard were examined in samples collected in 2012 and 2013. Fluids from the Beebe Vents and Beebe Woods black smokers vent at a maximum temperature of 398 °C at the seafloor, however several lines of evidence derived from inorganic chemistry (Cl, SiO2, Ca, Br, Fe, Cu, Mn) support fluid formation at much higher temperatures in the subsurface. These high temperatures, potentially in excess of 500 °C, are attainable due to the great depth of the system. Our data indicate that a single deep-rooted source fluid feeds high temperature vents across the entire Piccard field. High temperature Piccard fluid H2 abundances (19.9 mM) are even higher than those observed in many ultramafic-influenced systems, such as the Rainbow (16 mM) and the Von Damm hydrothermal fields (18.2 mM). In the case of Piccard, however, these extremely high H2 abundances can be generated from fluid-basalt reaction occurring at very high temperatures. Magmatic and thermogenic sources of carbon in the high temperature black smoker vents are described. Dissolved ΣCO2 is likely of magmatic origin, CH4 may originate from a combination of thermogenic sources and leaching of abiotic CH4 from mineral-hosted fluid inclusions, and CO abundances are at equilibrium with the water–gas shift reaction. Longer-chained n-alkanes (C2H6, C3H8, n-C4H10, i-C4H10) may derive from thermal alteration of dissolved and particulate organic carbon sourced from the original seawater source, entrainment of microbial ecosystems peripheral to high temperature venting, and/or abiotic mantle sources. Dissolved ΣHCOOH in the Beebe Woods fluid is consistent with thermodynamic equilibrium for abiotic production via ΣCO2 reduction with H2 at 354 °C measured temperature. A lack of ΣHCOOH in the relatively higher temperature 398 °C Beebe Vent fluids demonstrates the temperature sensitivity of this equilibrium. Abundant basaltic seafloor outcrops and the axial location of the vent field, along with multiple lines of geochemical evidence, support extremely high temperature fluid-rock reaction with mafic substrate as the dominant control on Piccard fluid chemistry. These results expand the known diversity of vent fluid composition, with implications for supporting microbiological life in both the modern and ancient ocean.},\n	journal = {Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta},\n	author = {McDermott, Jill M. and Sylva, Sean P. and Ono, Shuhei and German, Christopher R. and Seewald, Jeffrey S.},\n	year = {2018},\n	note = {Publisher: Elsevier Ltd},\n	pages = {95--118},\n	file = {McDermott et al. - 2018 - Geochemistry of fluids from Earth's deepest ridge-.pdf:/Users/shuheiono/Zotero/storage/W4JMWEQG/McDermott et al. - 2018 - Geochemistry of fluids from Earth's deepest ridge-.pdf:application/pdf},\n}`,

At PACMANUS and SuSu Knolls hydrothermal systems in the Eastern Manus Basin, a significant contribution of sulfur is derived from disproportionation of magmatic sulfur dioxide (SO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}), while the remaining sulfur is derived from crustal host rocks and SO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} reduction. At the sedimented Guaymas Basin hydrothermal system, sulfur sources include crustal host rock, reduced seawater SO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, and biogenic sulfide. Vent fluid flow through fresher, less-mature sediment supplies an increased quantity of reactant organic compounds that may reduce $^{\textrm{34}}$S-enriched SO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, while fluid interaction with more highly-altered sediments results in H{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}S characterized by a small, but isotopically-significant input of $^{\textrm{34}}$S-depleted biogenic sulfides.Near-zero δ$^{\textrm{33}}$S values in all samples implicate the abiotic processes of SO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} reduction and leaching of host rock as the major contributors to sulfur content at a high temperature unsedimented mid-ocean ridge and at a back-arc system. δ$^{\textrm{33}}$S values indicate that SO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} disproportionation is an additional process that contributes sulfur to a different back-arc system and to acid spring-type hydrothermal fluid circulation. At the sedimented Guaymus Basin, near-zero δ$^{\textrm{33}}$S values are also observed, despite negative δ$^{\textrm{34}}$S values that indicate inputs of biogenic pyrite for some samples.In contrast with previous studies reporting isotope disequilibrium between H{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}S and chalcopyrite, the δ$^{\textrm{34}}$S values of chalcopyrite sampled from the inner 1-2mm of a chimney wall are within ±1‰ of δ$^{\textrm{34}}$S values for H{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}S in the paired vent fluid, suggesting equilibrium fluid-mineral sulfur isotope exchange at 300-400°C.

Our results show that upper Rhaetian strata are characterized by 34S-enriched pyrite, low Spy/TOC ratios, and values of Δ33Spy (i.e., the deviation from the mass-dependent array) lower than that estimated for contemporaneous seawater sulfate, suggesting an oxic-suboxic depositional environment punctuated by brief anoxic events. The overlying Hettangian strata exhibit relatively 34S-depleted pyrite, high Δ33Spy, and Spy/TOC values, and the presence of green sulfur bacterial biomarkers indicate a shift toward to euxinic conditions. The local development of intense marine anoxia thus postdated the Tr-J mass extinction, which does not provide support for the hypothesis that euxinia was the main killing agent at the Tr-J transition. Sulfur and organic carbon isotopic records that reveal a water-depth gradient (i.e., more 34S-, 13C-depleted with depth) in combination with Spy/TOC data suggest that the earliest Jurassic EES was strongly stratified, with a chemocline located at shallow depths just below storm wave base. Shallow oceanic stratification may have been a factor for widespread deposition of black shales, a large positive shift in carbonate δ13C values, and a delay in the recovery of marine ecosystems following the Tr-J boundary crisis.},\n	journal = {Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta},\n	author = {Luo, Genming and Richoz, Sylvain and van de Schootbrugge, Bas and Algeo, Thomas J. and Xie, Shucheng and Ono, Shuhei and Summons, Roger E.},\n	year = {2018},\n	note = {Publisher: Elsevier Ltd},\n	keywords = {Sulfur isotopes, Black shale, Epeiric sea, Isorenieratane, Oceanic anoxia, Oceanic stratification},\n	pages = {73--87},\n}`,

Compared with the control, 3NOP decreased methane emission by 31\% and increased hydrogen emission from undetectable to 1.33 g/d. Methane emissions per kilogram of dry matter intake and milk yield were also decreased 34\% by 3NOP. Milk production and composition were not affected by 3NOP, except milk fat concentration was increased compared with the control. Concentrations of total VFA and propionate in ruminal fluid were not affected by treatment, but acetate concentration tended to be lower and acetate-to-propionate ratio was lower for 3NOP compared with the control. The 3NOP decreased the molar proportion of acetate and increase those of propionate, butyrate, valerate, and isovalerate. Deuterium-to-hydrogen ratios of methane and the abundance of 13CH3D were similar between treatments. Compared with the control, minor (4‰) depletion in the 13C/12C ratio was observed for 3NOP.

Accordingly, the sulfur isotopic composition (δ34S) of pyrite has been widely employed as a geochemical tool to probe the evolution of ocean chemistry. Characteristics of the depositional environment and post-depositional processes, however, can modify the δ34S signal that is captured in sedimentary pyrite and ultimately preserved in the geological record. Exploring sulfur and iron diagenesis within the Bornholm Basin, Baltic Sea, we find that higher sedimentation rates limit the near-surface sulfidization of reactive iron, facilitating its burial and hence the subsurface availability of reactive iron for continued and progressively more 34S-enriched sediment-hosted pyrite formation (δ34S ≈ –5‰). Using a diagenetic model, we show that the amount of pyrite formed at the sediment-water interface has increased over the past few centuries in response to expansion of water-column hypoxia, which also impacts the sulfur isotopic signature of pyrite at depth. This contribution highlights the critical role of reactive iron in pyrite formation and questions to what degree pyrite δ34S values truly reflect past global ocean chemistry and biogeochemical processes.

The OCS gas at 3.7 to 501 mbar was irradiated with or without a N2 bath gas using a 150 W Xe arc lamp. Sulfur isotope ratios for the product S0 and residual OCS were analyzed by an isotope ratio mass-spectrometer with SF6 as the analyte gas. The isotope fractionation after correction for the reservoir effects is-6.8\% for the ratio 34S/32S, where product S0 is depleted in heavy isotopes. The magnitude of the overall isotope effect is not sensitive to the addition of N2 but increases to-9.5\% when radiation of lambda; {\textgreater} 285 nm is used. The measured isotope effect reflects that of photolysis as well as the subsequent sulfur abstraction (from OCS) reaction. The magnitude of isotope effects for the abstraction reaction is estimated by transition state theory to be between-18.9 and-3.1\% for 34S which gives the photolysis isotope effect as-10.5 to +5.3\%. The observed triple isotope coefficients are ln(δ33S + 1)/ln(δ34S + 1) Combining double low line 0.534 ± 0.005 and ln(δ36S + 1) /ln(δ34S + 1) Combining double low line 1.980 ± 0.021.

Sulfate reducing microorganisms can impart a wide range in mass-dependent sulfur isotopic fractionation. As such, the presence and relative activity of these organisms is identifiable from geological materials. By extension, sulfur isotope records are used to infer the redox balance of marine sedimentary environments, and the oxidation state of Earth's oceans and atmosphere. However, recent work suggests that our understanding of microbial sulfate reduction (MSRs) may be missing complexity associated with the presence and role of key chemical intermediates in the reductive process. This study provides a test of proposed metabolic models of sulfate reduction by growing an axenic culture of the well-studied MSRs, Desulfovibrio alaskensis strain G20, under electron donor limited conditions on the terminal electron acceptors sulfate, sulfite or thiosulfate, and tracking the multiple S isotopic consequences of each condition set. The dissimilatory reduction of thiosulfate and sulfite produce unique minor isotope effects, as compared to the reduction of sulfate. Further, these experiments reveal a complex biochemistry associated with sulfite reduction. That is, under high sulfite concentrations, sulfur is shuttled to an intermediate pool of thiosulfate. Site-specific isotope fractionation (within thiosulfate) is very large (34ε {\textasciitilde} 30‰) while terminal product sulfide carries only a small fractionation from the initial sulfite (34ε {\textless} 10‰): a signature similar in magnitude to sulfate and thiosulfate reduction.

Recent investigations showed that, in some deep, fluid-filled fractures in the Witwatersrand Basin, South Africa, methanogens contribute {\textless}5\% of the total DNA and appear to produce sufficient CH4 to support the rest of the diverse community. This paradoxical situation reflects our lack of knowledge about the in situ metabolic diversity and the overall ecological trophic structure of SLiMEs. Here, we show the active metabolic processes and interactions in one of these communities by combining metatranscriptomic assemblies, metaproteomic and stable isotopic data, and thermodynamic modeling. Dominating the active community are four autotrophic β-proteobacterial genera that are capable of oxidizing sulfur by denitrification, a process that was previously unnoticed in the deep subsurface. They co-occur with sulfate reducers, anaerobic methane oxidizers, and methanogens, which each comprise {\textless}5\% of the total community. Syntrophic interactions between these microbial groups remove thermodynamic bottlenecks and enable diverse metabolic reactions to occur under the oligotrophic conditions that dominate in the subsurface. The dominance of sulfur oxidizers is explained by the availability of electron donors and acceptors to these microorganisms and the ability of sulfur-oxidizing denitrifiers to gain energy through concomitant S and H2 oxidation. We demonstrate that SLiMEs support taxonomically and metabolically diverse microorganisms, which, through developing syntrophic partnerships, overcome thermodynamic barriers imposed by the environmental conditions in the deep subsurface.},\n	number = {49},\n	journal = {Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America},\n	author = {Lau, Maggie C.Y. and Kieft, Thomas L. and Kuloyo, Olukayode and Linage-Alvarez, Borja and Van Heerden, Esta and Lindsay, Melody R. and Magnabosco, Cara and Wang, Wei and Wiggins, Jessica B. and Guo, Ling and Perlman, David H. and Kyin, Saw and Shwe, Henry H. and Harris, Rachel L. and Oh, Youmi and Yi, Min Joo and Purtschert, Roland and Slater, Greg F. and Ono, Shuhei and Wei, Siwen and Li, Long and Lollar, Barbara Sherwood and Onstott, Tullis C.},\n	year = {2016},\n	keywords = {Active subsurface environment, Inverted biomass pyramid, Metabolic interactions, Sulfur-driven autotrophic denitrifiers, Syntrophy},\n	pages = {E7927--E7936},\n}`,

Our investigation focused on laboratory experiments of the UV photolysis of phenacylphenylsulfone as a model system. This system was chosen due to previous measurements of Δ 33S (not Δ 36S) by a low precision SO 2 method indicating the occurrence of anomalous fractionation in 33S.The photolysis of PPS in micellar solution produced MIF of 33S in residual PPS ranging from depletion by -2.1‰ to enrichment by 6.4‰, with small mass-dependent fractionation of δ 34S up to 2.1‰. While this magnitude of 33S anomaly is comparable to the range of values observed in Archean rocks, no anomaly in 36S was detected for the 32S- 34S- 36S system beyond analytical precision (0.19‰). These results confirm the anomalous fractionation to be caused most likely by magnetic isotope effects (MIE), affecting only the nuclear spin possessing 33S among the four stable isotopes of sulfur. The observed initial depletion of 33S in the reactant PPS was unexpected and suggests changing contributions of at least two spin-selective processes.

Sulfur isotope analysis has been used to investigate sources and chemical processes of sulfur dioxide and sulfate in the atmosphere, however interpretation of measured sulfur isotope ratios is challenging due to a lack of reliable information on the isotopic fractionation involved in major transformation pathways. This paper presents laboratory measurements of the fractionation factors for the major atmospheric oxidation reactions for SO2: Gas-phase oxidation by OH radicals, and aqueous oxidation by H2O 2, O3 and a radical chain reaction initiated by iron. The measured fractionation factor for 34S/32S during the gas-phase reaction is αOH Combining double low line (1.0089\&plusmn;0.0007)-((4\&plusmn;5) \&times;10-5) T( C). The measured fractionation factor for 34S/32S during aqueous oxidation by H2O2 or O3 is αaq Combining double low line (1.0167\&plusmn;0.0019)-((8.7\&plusmn;3.5) \&times;10-5)T( C). The observed fractionation during oxidation by H 2O2 and O3 appeared to be controlled primarily by protonation and acid-base equilibria of S(IV) in solution, which is the reason that there is no significant difference between the fractionation produced by the two oxidants within the experimental error. The isotopic fractionation factor from a radical chain reaction in solution catalysed by iron is αFe Combining double low line (0.9894\&plusmn;0.0043) at 19 C for 34S/32S. Fractionation was mass-dependent with regards to 33S/32S for all the reactions investigated. The radical chain reaction mechanism was the only measured reaction that had a faster rate for the light isotopes. The results presented in this study will be particularly useful to determine the importance of the transition metal-catalysed oxidation pathway compared to other oxidation pathways, but other main oxidation pathways can not be distinguished based on stable sulfur isotope measurements alone. © 2012 Author(s).

Although temperature dependence of fractionation factors was found to be significant for H 2O2 and TMI-catalyzed pathways, results from a simple 1D model revealed that changing partitioning between oxidation pathways was the dominant cause of seasonality in the isotopic composition of sulfate relative to SO2. Comparison of modeled seasonality with observations shows the TMI-catalyzed oxidation pathway is underestimated by more than an order of magnitude in all current atmospheric chemistry models. The three reactions showed an approximately mass-dependent relationship between 33S and 34S. However, the slope of the mass-dependent line was significantly different to 0.515 for the OH and TMI-catalyzed pathways, reflecting kinetic versus equilibrium control of isotopic fractionation. For the TMI-catalyzed pathway, both temperature dependence and 33S/34S relationship revealed a shift in the rate-limiting reaction step from dissolution at lower temperatures to TMI-sulfite complex formation at higher temperatures. 1D model results showed that although individual reactions could produce Δ33S values between -0.15 and +0.2‰, seasonal changes in partitioning between oxidation pathways caused average sulfate Δ33S values of 0‰ throughout the year. © 2013 American Chemical Society.},\n	number = {21},\n	journal = {Environmental Science and Technology},\n	author = {Harris, Eliza and Sinha, Bärbel and Hoppe, Peter and Ono, Shuhei},\n	year = {2013},\n	pages = {12174--12183},\n	file = {Harris et al. - 2013 - High-precision measurements of 33S and 34S fractio.pdf:/Users/shuheiono/Zotero/storage/4NETEYP3/Harris et al. - 2013 - High-precision measurements of 33S and 34S fractio.pdf:application/pdf},\n}`,

These geochemical data vary relative to depositional facies (proximal marine, distal marine and fluvial-dominated) and tectonic setting (trailing margin and foreland basin).In the trailing margin setting of the {\textasciitilde}2.96Ga Hospital Hill Subgroup, the proximal marine depofacies is characterized by relatively high organic carbon contents (up to 0.9wt.\%) and δ 13C org values around -28‰, in contrast to the distal marine depofacies that yields low organic carbon contents (0.01wt.\%) and high δ 13C org values (up to -22‰). Both depofacies yield low sulfur contents (0.02wt.‰), a narrow range of δ 34S values ({\textasciitilde}+3±2‰) and positive Δ 33S values (up to +1.9‰). This data is consistent with photoautotrophic carbon fixation in shallow marine environments and limited organic carbon production/preservation in deeper water settings due to longer transport distances and effective biological degradation (e.g., Fe-reducing microbes). Positive Δ 33S values imply that sulfur was largely derived from a photochemical elemental sulfur reservoir. In the foreland basin tectonic setting of the {\textasciitilde}2.94Ga Government and {\textasciitilde}2.92Ga Jeppestown subgroups, shelf deposits associated with fluvial braidplain depofacies are characterized by 13C-depleted organic carbon ({\textasciitilde}-44 to -38‰), relatively high sulfur contents (0.2-1.3wt.\%), variable δ 34S values (-3.7 to +16.5‰) and small negative Δ 33S values ({\textasciitilde}-0.4‰). These data suggest that the microbial community in the fluvial-dominated depofacies may have consisted of photoautotrophs, methanogens, anaerobic methanotrophs and sulfate reducers. Sulfate was derived from a variety of sources that include photochemical, crustal and marine sulfur reservoirs.The occurrence of three regionally persistent diamictite deposits in the Government Subgroup coincides with the onset of compressional tectonics and development of pyritic shales with highly 13C-depleted organic carbon, suggesting that an increase in continental sulfur flux and methane oxidation may have triggered the Mesoarchean glaciations (drawdown of H 2 and CH 4).

The multiple sulfur isotope values of the thermal fluids are interpreted to reflect various sources of sulfur in the fluids, as well as isotope fractionation occurring within the geothermal systems associated with fluid-rock interaction, boiling and oxidation and reduction reactions. The results of isotope geochemical modeling demonstrate that the sources of S− IIin the thermal fluid are leaching of basalt (MORB) and seawater SO4reduction for saline systems with insignificant magma gas input, and that the observed ranges of δ34S and Δ33S for ∑ S− IIand H2S(g) reflect isotope fractionation between minerals and aqueous and gaseous species upon fluid-rock interaction and boiling. The sources of SO4are taken to be multiple, including oxidation of S− IIoriginating from basalt, leaching of SVIfrom the basalts and the seawater itself in the case of saline systems. In low-temperature fluids, the δ34S and Δ33S values reflect the various sources of sulfur. For high-temperature fluids, fluid-rock interaction, ∑ S− IIoxidation and SO4reduction and sulfide and sulfate mineral formation result in a large range of δ34S and Δ33S values for ∑ S− IIand SO4in the fluids, highlighting the importance and effects of chemical reactions on the isotope systematics of reactive elements like sulfur.

The six month long 2014–15 Bárðarbunga volcanic eruption was the largest in Iceland for more than 200 years and it released into the atmosphere an average of 60 kt/day SO2, 30 kt/day CO2, 500 t/day HCl and 280 t/day HF. To study the effect of this eruption on the winter precipitation, snow cores were collected from the Vatnajökull glacier and the highlands northeast of the glacier. In addition to 29 bulk snow cores from that precipitated from September 2014 until March 2015, two cores were sampled in 21 and 44 increments to quantify the spatial and time evolution of the chemical composition of the snow. The pH and chemical compositions of melted snow samples indicate that snow has been affected by the volcanic gases emitted during the Bárðarbunga eruption. The pH of the melted bulk snow cores ranged from 4.41 to 5.64 with an average value of 5.01. This is four times greater H+ activity than pure water saturated with the atmospheric CO2. The highest concentrations of volatiles in the snow cores were found close to the eruption site as predicted from CALPUFF SO2 gas dispersion quality model. The anion concentrations (SO4, Cl, and F) were higher and the pH was lower compared to equivalent snow samples collected during 1997–2006 from the unpolluted Icelandic Langjökull glacier. Higher SO4 and Cl concentrations in the snow compared with the unpolluted rainwater of marine origin confirm the addition of a non–seawater SO4 and Cl. The δ34S isotopic composition confirms that the sulphur addition is of volcanic aerosol origin. The chemical evolution of the snow with depth reflects changes in the lava effusion and gas emission rates. Those rates were the highest at the early stage of the eruption. Snow that fell during that time, represented by samples from the deepest part of the snow cores, had the lowest pH and highest concentrations of SO4, F, Cl and metals, compared with snow that fell later in the winter. Also the Al concentration, did exceed World Health Organisation drinking water standard of 3.7 μmol/kg in the lower part of the snow core closest to the eruption site. Collected snow represents the precipitation that fell during the eruption period. Nevertheless, only minor environmental impacts are evident in the snow due to its interaction with the volcanic aerosol gases.

None of the meteorites show evidence of mass dependent Te isotope fractionations larger than 2‰ for δ126/128Te. Following internal normalization of the data to 125Te/128Te, the Te isotope ratios of all analyzed meteorites were found to be identical to a terrestrial standard, within uncertainties.

The data acquired for bulk carbonaceous chondrites indicate that the initial 126Sn/118Sn ratio of the solar system was {\textless} 4 × 10-5, but this is dependent on the assumption that no redistribution of Sn and Te occurred since the start of the solar system. Five Archean sedimentary sulfides that display both mass dependent and mass-independent isotope effects for S yield internally normalized Te isotope data, which indicate that mass-independent Te isotope effects are absent.

Similar to other Phanerozoic ophiolite sequences, the Tablelands possess environmental conditions that are conducive to all three established pathways of methanogenesis – abiogenic, microbial, and thermogenic – or a combination thereof. Sourcing methane from the Tablelands has thus far been limited because of the low dissolved methane concentrations. We tested dissolved gas extraction and concentration methods (vacuum extraction and gas stripping) for their effect on isotopic fractionation, and we applied these methods to sample dissolved methane for carbon and hydrogen isotopes (δ13CCH4 and δDCH4) as well as doubly substituted “clumped” isotopologue (13CH3D) analyses. Clumped isotope thermometry of methane estimated an apparent temperature of 85 ± 7 °C. The carbon isotope value of methane (δ13CCH4) for samples collected in 2017 was −27.9 ± 0.5‰, consistent with previously measured values (−27.3 ± 0.5‰) dating back to 2009. The hydrogen isotope value of methane (δDCH4) in 2017 was −175 ± 5‰. On a carbon deuterium (CD) plot, the Tablelands methane data plotted outside of the microbial field, but within an area where abiogenic and thermogenic fields overlap. A conclusive discrimination between abiogenic and thermogenic methanogenic pathways remains challenging. Nevertheless, a combination of sedimentary organic matter characterization of the underlying sedimentary units and comparison of geochemical characteristics with those described in experimental and theoretical studies suggest that the methane extracted from the Tablelands is likely a result of slow production of methane at {\textasciitilde}85 °C from background organic sources.},\n	journal = {Chemical geology},\n	author = {Cumming, Emily A and Rietze, Amanda and Morrissey, Liam S and Cook, Melissa C and Rhim, Jeemin H and Ono, Shuhei and Morrill, Penny L},\n	year = {2019},\n	keywords = {Clumped isotope thermometry, Methane sourcing, Phanerozoic ophiolite, Stable carbon and hydrogen isotopes, Tablelands Gros Morne National Park},\n	pages = {42--53},\n	file = {Cumming et al. - 2019 - Potential sources of dissolved methane at the Tabl.pdf:/Users/shuheiono/Zotero/storage/5FN8XQ7K/Cumming et al. - 2019 - Potential sources of dissolved methane at the Tabl.pdf:application/pdf},\n}`,

The details of sulfur transfer from sedimentary rocks to magmas (and ultimately igneous rocks) through metamorphism and devolatilization and/or partial melting, however, is difficult to trace. To understand this process in detail we studied multiple-sulfur isotope compositions of sulfides in the Archean (c. 2685 Ma) Ghost Lake batholith (GLB) and its surrounding host metasedimentary rocks of the Superior Craton (Ontario, Canada) by high spatial resolution secondary ion mass spectrometry, complemented by high-precision gas source isotope ratio mass spectrometry measurements. The GLB comprises strongly peraluminous biotite+cordierite, biotite+muscovite, and muscovite+garnet+tourmaline granites to leucogranites, which are thought to represent the partial melts of surrounding metagreywackes and metapelites. The metasedimentary rocks display a range of metamorphic grades increasing from biotite-chlorite (280-380 °C) at ∼5 km away from the GLB to sillimanite-K-feldspar grade (∼660 °C) immediately adjacent to the batholith, thus providing a natural experiment to understand sulfur isotope variations from low- to high-grade Archean sedimentary rocks, as well as granites representative of their partial melts. We find that metasedimentary sulfide δ34S values increase with progressive metamorphism at most 2-3‰ (from −1‰ up to +1 to +2‰). An increase in δ34S values in pyrrhotite during prograde metamorphism can be explained through Rayleigh fractionation during pyrite desulfidation reactions. Pyrite from all but one of the granite samples preserve δ34S values similar to that of the high-grade metasedimentary rocks, indicating that partial melting did not result in significant fractionation of δ34S. The exception to this is one granite sample from a part of the batholith characterized by abundant metasedimentary inclusions. This sample contains pyrite with heterogeneous and low δ34S values (down to −16‰) which likely resulted from incomplete homogenization of sulfur between the granitic melt and metasedimentary inclusions. Small (several tenths of a permil), mostly positive Δ33S are observed in both the metasedimentary rocks and granites. Our results suggest that Archean strongly peraluminous granites could be a high-fidelity archive to quantify the bulk sulfur isotope composition of the Archean siliciclastic sediments. Further, our findings indicate that subduction of reduced sulfur-bearing sediments in the Archean with δ34S at or near 0‰ should result in release of sulfur-bearing fluids in the mantle wedge with similar values (within a few permil). S-MIF (if initially present in Archean surface material) may be preserved during this process. However, the absence of S-MIF in igneous rocks does not preclude assimilation of Archean sedimentary material as either S-MIF may not be originally present in the Archean sedimentary sulfur and/or homogenization or dilution could obscure any S-MIF originally present in assimilated Archean sediments.},\n	journal = {Earth and Planetary Science Letters},\n	author = {Bucholz, Claire E. and Biasi, Joseph A. and Beaudry, Patrick and Ono, Shuhei},\n	year = {2020},\n	keywords = {Archean, anatexis, granite, metasedimentary rocks, sulfur},\n	pages = {116494--116494},\n}`,

These measurements are consistent with the previously reported correlations of oxygen and sulfur isotope fractionations with the cell-specific rate of MSR: faster reduction rates produced smaller isotopic fractionations for all isotopes.

These experiments help reconstruct and interpret processes that operate in natural pore waters characterized by high 18O/16O and moderate 34S/32S ratios and suggest that some multiple isotope signals in the environment cannot be explained by microbial sulfate reduction alone.

In addition to the oxidation of buried organic matter, sulfate reduction can be coupled to the oxidation of methane migrating upward. Multiple sulfur isotope ratios were measured for porewater sulfate, sulﬁde, elemental sulfur and pyrite from core samples collected from continental shelf (19–96 m water depth) in the Baltic Sea and slope (1098 m water depth) in the Andaman Sea, in order to test if their isotope systematics can be used to trace the two diﬀerent sulfate reduction processes. For shallow shelf sediments ({\textless}43 cm below seaﬂoor), both d34S and D33S values of porewater sulfate increased with increasing depth as a result of organoclastic sulfate reduction (OSR). However, the D33S values of both porewater sulfate and sulﬁde decreased as the d34S values increased downcore at 43–73 cm depth where sulfate reduction was coupled to anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). Pyrite in shelf sediments yielded positive D33S values, reﬂecting D33S of porewater sulﬁde produced by OSR. In contrast, pyrite in slope sediments yielded negative D33S values as low as À0.15‰, as a result of mixing of sulﬁdes derived from OSR and AOM. This is consistent with the slowly migrating sulfate–methane transition (SMT) in slope sediments inferred from sulfur and iron speciation, carbon isotope ratios of carbonates, and magnetic susceptibility data. A stable SMT, focusing AOM at roughly the same depth over the past few millennia, further provides favorable conditions for prolonged pyrite formation with the development of cubic crystals, while the sulfur isotope diﬀerence between bulk pyrite and macroscopic pyrite reﬂects the signiﬁcance of OSR throughout the sediment column. We conclude that minor sulfur isotopes provide a unique proxy that can be applied to diﬀerentiate OSR and AOM and the origin of pyrite in diverse sediments and sedimentary rocks.},\n	language = {en},\n	urldate = {2022-07-10},\n	journal = {Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta},\n	author = {Liu, Jiarui and Pellerin, André and Wang, Jiasheng and Rickard, David and Antler, Gilad and Zhao, Jie and Wang, Zhou and Jørgensen, Bo Barker and Ono, Shuhei},\n	month = jan,\n	year = {2022},\n	pages = {309--330},\n	file = {Liu et al. - 2022 - Multiple sulfur isotopes discriminate organoclasti.pdf:/Users/shuheiono/Zotero/storage/3ICSMF56/Liu et al. - 2022 - Multiple sulfur isotopes discriminate organoclasti.pdf:application/pdf},\n}`,

However, processes such as boiling, magma degassing, fluid-rock interaction and associated redox reactions often obscure the origin of sulfur in the system. The multiple sulfur isotope system is a powerful tool to unravel the processes that affect isotope ratios of sulfur in geothermal systems. Here, we utilized concentrations and multiple isotope ratios (32S/33S/34S/36S) of sulfur from well discharge from geothermal fields at Olkaria, SE Kenya, to investigate the hydrothermal processes and to quantify the sources of sulfur to the system. Fluid sampling temperatures ranged from 157 to 204 ◦C, and the sampled fluids had low Cl concentrations (119 to 1267 ppm Cl) with both liquid water and vapor being present. The concentration of H2S and SO4 in the water phase of the well discharges ranged from 0.53 to 68.0 ppm and from 4.7 to 108 ppm, respectively. In the vapor phase, H2S was the only observed sulfur compound with concentrations between 1.18 and 214 μmol mol− 1. In the water phase, δ34S values for H2S and SO4 ranged from − 1.2 to +4.0‰ and +0.7 to +7.7‰, respectively. The δ34S values of H2S in the vapor phase ranged from +2.0 to +11.3‰. The Δ33S values for H2S in the water and vapor phase were found to be between − 0.017 and +0.021‰ and − 0.042 and +0.008‰, respectively, and for SO4 in the water phase between − 0.024 and + 0.004‰. Sulfur isotopes of H2S in liquid phase were depleted in 34S as a result of depressurization boiling. Sulfur isotope ratios as well as the results of geochemical modelling suggest that sulfide in the fluids dominantly originated from rock leaching where insignificant amounts of sulfur was derived from direct degassing of a magmatic source. Sulfate primarily derived from the oxidation of H2S to SO4 upon fluid ascent to the surface. Based on the geochemical model results and measured sulfur concentrations, the annual natural H2S emission rate at Olkaria was estimated to range from 320 to 510 t H2S yr− 1. These comparatively low sulfur emissions and the lack of significant sulfur sources (e.g., magma or seawater) imply that Olkaria could represent an ideal re-injection site for anthropogenic H2S even if sulfur sequestration rates would be low.},\n	language = {en},\n	urldate = {2022-07-10},\n	journal = {Chemical Geology},\n	author = {Kleine, Barbara I. and Gunnarsson-Robin, Jóhann and Kamunya, Kennedy M. and Ono, Shuhei and Stefánsson, Andri},\n	month = nov,\n	year = {2021},\n	pages = {120446},\n	file = {Kleine et al. - 2021 - Source controls on sulfur abundance and isotope fr.pdf:/Users/shuheiono/Zotero/storage/C9NQBRYW/Kleine et al. - 2021 - Source controls on sulfur abundance and isotope fr.pdf:application/pdf},\n}`,

While sulfur isotope ratio analyses of materials such as bulk rock samples, gases, and sulfide grains are routinely carried out, in-situ an­ alyses of silicate glasses such as those formed in magmatic systems are relatively scarce in the literature. Despite a number of attempts in recent years to analyse sulfur isotope ratios in volcanic and experimental glasses by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), the effects of instrumental mass fractionation (IMF) during analysis remain poorly understood. In this study we use more than 600 sulfur isotope analyses of nine different glasses to characterise the matrix effects that arise during sulfur isotope analysis of glasses by SIMS. Samples were characterised for major element composition, sulfur content, and sulfur isotope ratios by independent methods. Our glasses contain between 500 and 3400 ppm sulfur and cover a wide compositional range, including low-silica basanite, rhyolite, and phonolite, allowing us to investigate composition-dependent IMF. We use SIMS in multi-collection mode with a Faraday cup/ electron multiplier detector configuration to achieve uncertainty of 0.3‰ to 2‰ (2σ) on measured δ34S. At high sulfur content, the analytical error of our SIMS analyses is similar to that of bulk analytical methods, such as gas-source isotope ratio mass spectrometry. We find IMF causes an offset of − 12‰ to +1‰ between bulk sulfur isotope ratios and those measured by SIMS. Instrumental mass fractionation correlates non-linearly with glass sulfur contents and with a multivariate regression model combining glass Al, Na, and K contents. Both ln(S) and Al-Na-K models are capable of predicting IMF with good accuracy: 84\% (ln(S)) and 87\% (Al-Na-K) of our analyses can be reproduced within 2σ combined analytical uncertainty after a correction for composition-dependent IMF is applied. The process driving IMF is challenging to identify. The non-linear correlation between glass S content and IMF in our dataset resembles previously documented correlation between glass H2O abundance and IMF during D/H ratio analyses by SIMS, and could be attributed to changes in 32S− and 34S− ion yields with changing S content and glass composition. However, a clear correlation between S ion yields and S content cannot be identified in our dataset. We speculate that accumulation of alkalis at the SIMS crater floor may be the principal driving force of composition-dependent IMF. Nonetheless, other currently unknown factors could also influence IMF observed during S isotope ratio analyses of glasses by SIMS.

Growth phase and hydrogen (H2) concentration have been proposed as factors controlling the isotopic compositions of methane produced via hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, but their effects on the relationship among carbon, hydrogen and doubly-substituted “clumped” isotopologue systems have not been assessed in a quantitative framework. Here we experimentally investigate the bulk (δ13C and δD) and clumped (Δ13CH3D) isotopologue compositions of methane produced by hyperthermophilic hydrogenotrophic (CO2-reducing) methanogens using batch and fed-batch systems at different growth phases and H2 mixing ratios (Methanocaldococcus bathoardescens at 82 or 60 °C and on 80 or 25 \% H2; Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus str.

In contrast, hydrogen isotope fractionations remained relatively constant at –317 ± 25 ‰. Linear growth was observed for experiments with M. bathoardescens, suggesting that dissolution of gaseous H2 into liquid media became the rate limit as cell density increased. Accordingly, the low (and undersaturated) dissolved H2 concentrations can explain the increased carbon isotope fractionations during the later growth phase. The δD and Δ13CH3D values indicated departure from equilibrium throughout experiments. As the cell density increased and dissolved H2 decreased, Δ13CH3D decreased (further departure from equilibrium), contrary to expectations from previous models. Our isotopologue flow network model reproduced the observed trends when the last H-addition step is less reversible relative to the first three H-addition steps (up to CH3-CoM). In this differential reversibility model, carbon, hydrogen and clumped isotopologue fractionations are largely controlled by the reversibility of the first three H-addition steps under high H2 concentrations; the last H-addition step becomes important under low H2. The magnitude of depletion and decreasing trend in Δ13CH3D values were reproduced when a large (≥6 ‰) secondary clumped kinetic isotope effect was considered in the model.

Icelandic basalts present ideal material to examine the oldest known terrestrial mantle reservoir, accessed through a deep-rooted mantle plume, but their multiple sulfur isotope systematics have not been explored previously. Here, we present new sulfur concentration (30–1570 ppm) and isotope data (δ34S = −2.5 to +3.8‰ and Δ33S = −0.045 to +0.016‰; vs. Canyon Diablo Troilite) from a sample suite (n = 62) focused on subglacially erupted basaltic glasses obtained from Iceland's neovolcanic zones. Using these data along with trace element systematics to account for the effects of magmatic processes (degassing and immiscible sulfide melt formation) on δ34S, we show that primitive (MgO {\textgreater} 6 wt.\%), least degassed glasses accurately record the δ34S signatures of their mantle sources. Compared to the depleted MORB source mantle (DMM; δ34S = −1.3±0.3‰), the Iceland mantle is shown to have a greater range of δ34S values between −2.5 and −0.1\%. Similarly, Icelandic basalts are characterized by more variable and negatively shifted Δ33S values (−0.035 to +0.013‰) relative to DMM (0.004±006‰). Negative δ34S-Δ33S signatures are most prominent in basalts from the Snæfellsnes Volcanic Zone and the Kverkfjöll volcanic system, which also have the lowest, most MORB-like 3He/4He (8–9 R/RA, where RA is the 3He/4He of air) and the highest Ba/La (up to 12) in Iceland. We propose that subduction fluid-enriched, mantle wedge type material, possibly present in the North Atlantic upper mantle, constitutes a low-δ34S-Δ33S component in the Icelandic mantle. This suggests that volatile heterogeneity in Iceland, and potentially at other OIBs, may originate not only from diverse plume-associated mantle components, but also from a heterogeneous ambient upper mantle. By contrast, a set of samples with high 3He/4He (up to 25.9 R/RA) and negative μ182W anomalies define an ancient lower mantle reservoir with a near-chondritic Δ33S and δ34S signature of ∼0‰. The difference between DMM and the high high-3He/4He mantle may reflect separate conditions during core-mantle differentiation, or a previously unidentified flux of sulfur from the core to the high-3He/4He reservoir.},\n	language = {en},\n	urldate = {2022-09-12},\n	journal = {Earth and Planetary Science Letters},\n	author = {Ranta, Eemu and Gunnarsson-Robin, Jóhann and Halldórsson, Sæmundur A. and Ono, Shuhei and Izon, Gareth and Jackson, Matthew G. and Reekie, Callum D.

Reykjavik Energy is currently undertaking a pilot project at Hellisheidi power plant, SW Iceland, where H2S is injected together with wastewater to be sequestered in the geothermal reservoir. Multiple sulfur isotope ratios (δ34S and Δ33S) of injection and reservoir fluids were measured as a potential tracer for subsurface sulfide sequestration processes. The values for δ34S and Δ33S in the injected H2S-fluid and wastewater and reservoir geothermal fluids at Hellisheidi were +10.6‰ and +0.047‰, −2.86‰ and −0.005‰ and −2.5 to +0.9‰ and −0.031 and −0.001‰, respectively. Our geochemical and isotope modeling reveals that upon sulfide mineralization the δ34S value of the fluids in the production wells are expected to become lower due to pyrite precipitation, while the value of Δ33S is expected to be conservative upon mineralization and degassing. It follows sulfur sequestration and mixing process can be monitored by the triple sulfur (32S, 33S, 34S) isotope systematics. The total H2S emissions at Hellisheidi are ˜16 kt per year. Given the size of the geothermal reservoir and the expected production time span of the power plant of about 100–300 years, H2S sequestration in the geothermal reservoir is expected to be a sustainable solution for the reduction of power plant emissions.

Given its origin in oxygen-free photochemistry, mass-independent sulfur isotope fractionation (S-MIF) is widely accepted as a geochemical fingerprint of an anoxic atmosphere. Nevertheless, S-MIF recycling through oxidative sulfide weathering—commonly termed the crustal memory effect (CME)—potentially decouples the multiple sulfur isotope (MSI) record from coeval atmospheric chemistry. Herein, however, after accounting for unrecognised temporal and spatial biases within the Archaean–early-Palaeoproterozoic MSI record, we demonstrate that the global expression of the CME is barely resolvable; thereby validating S-MIF as a tracer of contemporaneous atmospheric chemistry during Earth’s incipient oxygenation. Next, utilising statistical approaches, supported by new MSI data, we show that the reconciliation of adjacent, yet seemingly discrepant, South African MSI records requires that the rare instances of post-2.3-billion-year-old S-MIF are stratigraphically restricted. Accepting others’ primary photochemical interpretation, our approach demands that these implied atmospheric dynamics were ephemeral, operating on sub-hundred-thousand-year timescales.

We report new CO2 and N2 isotope and relative abundance data in exceptionally gas-rich mantle peridotite and pyroxenite xenoliths from nine localities throughout the eastern branch of the East African Rift System (EARS). Importantly for our study, the xenolith localities straddle the transition between continental and oceanic lithosphere. In addition, we report major and trace element contents together with oxygen isotopes on host crystals and bulk multiple sulfur isotope data on select pyroxene crystals from the same xenolith suite. These new data are interpreted alongside previously published He, Ne and Ar isotope and relative abundance data. Pyroxenite xenoliths formed from the infiltration and crystallization of mafic melts in the lithospheric mantle. This was followed by fluids fracturing through the pyroxenites leaving gas-rich fluid inclusions. The elemental and isotope systematics of the fluid inclusion-hosted volatile species (He, Ar, N, CO2) within the mantle xenoliths are consistent with the enrichment of the EARS SCLM by CO2-rich mantle fluids from subducted carbonate-rich material. Such CO2 enrichments (CO2/3He {\textgreater} 7 × 109, δ13C {\textasciitilde}0‰) are also associated with positive δ15N values (as high as +3.4‰), reinforcing the link between the metasomatic fluids and subduction of hydrothermally altered oceanic crust. Recycled signatures are also consistent with oxygen and sulfur isotope compositions of host crystals, which are distinct from compositions typical for the depleted upper MORB-source mantle. The occurrence of recycled volatile signatures in the EARS SCLM is widespread and must therefore be associated with a large-scale mantle process currently supplying material to EARS magmas. Notably, mantle xenoliths with high 3He/4He from the Ethiopian Rift are also associated with δ15N and δ13C values similar to the composition of sediments.

Icelandic basalts present ideal material to examine the oldest known terrestrial mantle reservoir, accessed through a deep-rooted mantle plume, but their multiple sulfur isotope systematics have not been explored previously. Here, we present new sulfur concentration (30–1570 ppm) and isotope data (δ34S = −2.5 to +3.8‰ and Δ33S = −0.045 to +0.016‰; vs. Canyon Diablo Troilite) from a sample suite (n = 62) focused on subglacially erupted basaltic glasses obtained from Iceland's neovolcanic zones. Using these data along with trace element systematics to account for the effects of magmatic processes (degassing and immiscible sulfide melt formation) on δ34S, we show that primitive (MgO {\textgreater} 6 wt.\%), least degassed glasses accurately record the δ34S signatures of their mantle sources. Compared to the depleted MORB source mantle (DMM; δ34S = −1.3±0.3‰), the Iceland mantle is shown to have a greater range of δ34S values between −2.5 and −0.1\%. Similarly, Icelandic basalts are characterized by more variable and negatively shifted Δ33S values (−0.035 to +0.013‰) relative to DMM (0.004±006‰). Negative δ34S-Δ33S signatures are most prominent in basalts from the Snæfellsnes Volcanic Zone and the Kverkfjöll volcanic system, which also have the lowest, most MORB-like 3He/4He (8–9 R/RA, where RA is the 3He/4He of air) and the highest Ba/La (up to 12) in Iceland. We propose that subduction fluid-enriched, mantle wedge type material, possibly present in the North Atlantic upper mantle, constitutes a low-δ34S-Δ33S component in the Icelandic mantle. This suggests that volatile heterogeneity in Iceland, and potentially at other OIBs, may originate not only from diverse plume-associated mantle components, but also from a heterogeneous ambient upper mantle. By contrast, a set of samples with high 3He/4He (up to 25.9 R/RA) and negative μ182W anomalies define an ancient lower mantle reservoir with a near-chondritic Δ33S and δ34S signature of ∼0‰. The difference between DMM and the high high-3He/4He mantle may reflect separate conditions during core-mantle differentiation, or a previously unidentified flux of sulfur from the core to the high-3He/4He reservoir.},\n	language = {en},\n	urldate = {2022-09-12},\n	journal = {Earth and Planetary Science Letters},\n	author = {Ranta, Eemu and Gunnarsson-Robin, Jóhann and Halldórsson, Sæmundur A. and Ono, Shuhei and Izon, Gareth and Jackson, Matthew G. and Reekie, Callum D.

The diversity and ecophysiological role of soil microorganisms that can consume low atmospheric abundances of H2 with high-affinity [NiFe]-hydrogenases is unknown. We expanded the library of atmospheric H2-consuming strains to include four soil Harvard Forest Isolate (HFI) Streptomyces spp., Streptomyces cattleya and Rhodococcus equi by assaying for high-affinity hydrogenase (hhyL) genes and quantifying H2 uptake rates. We find that aerial structures (hyphae and spores) are important for StreptomycesH2 consumption; uptake was not observed in S.griseoflavusTu4000 (deficient in aerial structures) and was reduced by physical disruption of Streptomyces sp. HFI8 aerial structures. H2 consumption depended on the life cycle stage in developmentally distinct actinobacteria: Streptomyces sp. HFI8 (sporulating) and R.equi (non-sporulating, non-filamentous). Strain HFI8 took up H2 only after forming aerial hyphae and sporulating, while R.equi only consumed H2 in the late exponential and stationary phase. These observations suggest that conditions favouring H2 uptake by actinobacteria are associated with energy and nutrient limitation.

Archean sulfide and sulfate minerals commonly exhibit anomalous ratios among four stable sulfur isotopes, 32 S, 33 S, 34 S, and 36 S.

  '@article{Whitehill2015,\nabstract = {{\\textcopyright} Author(s) 2015.Signatures of sulfur isotope mass-independent fractionation (S-MIF) have been observed in stratospheric sulfate aerosols deposited in polar ice. The S-MIF signatures are thought to be associated with stratospheric photochemistry following stratospheric volcanic eruptions, but the exact mechanism responsible for the production and preservation of these signatures is debated. In order to identify the origin and the mechanism of preservation for these signatures, a series of laboratory photochemical experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of temperature and added O2 on the S-MIF produced by two absorption band systems of SO2: photolysis in the 190 to 220 nm region and photoexcitation in the 250 to 350 nm region. The SO2 photolysis (SO2 + h$\\nu$ → SO + O) experiments showed S-MIF signals with large 34S/34S fractionations, which increases with decreasing temperature. The overall S-MIF pattern observed for photolysis experiments, including high 34S/34S fractionations, positive mass-independent anomalies in 33S, and negative anomalies in 36S, is consistent with a major contribution from optical isotopologue screening effects and data for stratospheric sulfate aerosols. In contrast, SO2 photoexcitation produced products with positive S-MIF anomalies in both 33S and 36S, which is different from stratospheric sulfate aerosols. SO2 photolysis in the presence of O2 produced SO3 with S-MIF signals, suggesting the transfer of the S-MIF anomalies from SO to SO3 by the SO + O2 + M → SO3 + M reaction. This is supported with energy calculations of stationary points on the SO3 potential energy surfaces, which indicate that this reaction occurs slowly on a single adiabatic surface, but that it can occur more rapidly through intersystem crossing. Based on our experimental results, we estimate a termolecular rate constant on the order of 10-37 cm6 molecule-2 s-1. This rate can explain the preservation of mass independent isotope signatures in stratospheric sulfate aerosols and provides a minor, but important, oxidation pathway for stratospheric SO2. The production and preservation of S-MIF signals requires a high SO2 column density to allow for optical isotopologue screening effects to occur and to generate a large enough signature that it can be preserved. In addition, the SO2 plume must reach an altitude of around 20 to 25 km, where SO2 photolysis becomes a dominant process. These experiments are the first step towards understanding the origin of the sulfur isotope anomalies in stratospheric sulfate aerosols.},\nauthor = {Whitehill, A.R. and Jiang, B. and Guo, H. and Ono, S.},\ndoi = {10.5194/acp-15-1843-2015},\nfile = {:Users/shuheiono/Documents/Mendeley Desktop/Whitehill et al. - 2015.pdf:pdf},\nissn = {16807324 16807316},\njournal = {Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics},\nnumber = {4},\npages = {1843--1864},\ntitle = {{SO2 photolysis as a source for sulfur mass-independent isotope signatures in stratospehric aerosols}},\nvolume = {15},\nyear = {2015}\n}',

Optical filters (200±35nm bandpass and 250nm longpass filters) were used to separately access two different excitation bands of SO 2 in the 190-220nm and the 250-330nm absorption regions, respectively. UV irradiation of SO 2 in the 190-220nm and 250-330nm regions both produced elemental sulfur (S 0) and sulfur trioxide (SO 3) as end products but yielded very different sulfur isotope signatures. The elemental sulfur products from direct photolysis in the 190-220nm region were characterized by high $\\delta$ 34S values (154.7-212.0‰), modest $\\Delta$ 33S anomalies of 21±3‰, and relatively constant 33$\\lambda$ (=ln($\\delta$ 33S+1)/ln($\\delta$ 34S+1)) values of 0.64±0.3, all with respect to the initial SO 2. Photoexcitation in the 250-330nm region produced elemental sulfur with $\\delta$ 34S values of 7.7-29.1‰ and $\\Delta$ 33S values of 15.0±1.6‰. In both excitation regions, the SO 3 products were mass dependently fractionated relative to the SO 2 reservoir. The two different absorption regions produced contrasting $\\Delta$ 36S/$\\Delta$ 33S signatures in the elemental sulfur products, with $\\Delta$ 36S/$\\Delta$ 33S=-1.9±0.3 and 0.64±0.3 for the 190-220nm and 250-330nm bands, respectively. Our results provide several critical constraints on the origin of the S-MIF signatures observed in modern stratospheric aerosols and in the Archean geological record. A lack of S-MIF in the sulfate product and positive $\\Delta$ 36S/$\\Delta$ 33S ratios for the elemental sulfur from SO 2 photo-oxidation demonstrate that photoexcitation in the 250-330nm region is not a likely source for the S-MIF observed in modern stratospheric aerosols. Large $\\delta$ 34S fractionation, 33$\\lambda$ values, and $\\Delta$ 36S/$\\Delta$ 33S ratios observed for the 190-220nm band are qualitatively consistent with predictions from synthetic isotopologue-specific cross sections. These isotope patterns, however, are not compatible with the Archean rock record. We explore the possibility that S-MIF from both the 190 to 220nm and the 250 to 330nm absorption bands could have contributed to the Archean S-MIF signatures. {\\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},\nauthor = {Whitehill, A.R. and Ono, S.},\ndoi = {10.1016/j.gca.2012.06.014},\nfile = {:Users/shuheiono/Documents/Mendeley Desktop/Whitehill, Ono - 2012.pdf:pdf},\nissn = {00167037},\njournal = {Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta},\npages = {238--253},\ntitle = {{Excitation band dependence of sulfur isotope mass-independent fractionation during photochemistry of sulfur dioxide using broadband light sources}},\nvolume = {94},\nyear = {2012}\n}',

The details of sulfur transfer from sedimentary rocks to magmas (and ultimately igneous rocks) through metamorphism and devolatilization and/or partial melting, however, is difficult to trace. To understand this process in detail we studied multiple-sulfur isotope compositions of sulfides in the Archean (c. 2685 Ma) Ghost Lake batholith (GLB) and its surrounding host metasedimentary rocks of the Superior Craton (Ontario, Canada) by high spatial resolution secondary ion mass spectrometry, complemented by high-precision gas source isotope ratio mass spectrometry measurements. The GLB comprises strongly peraluminous biotite+cordierite, biotite+muscovite, and muscovite+garnet+tourmaline granites to leucogranites, which are thought to represent the partial melts of surrounding metagreywackes and metapelites. The metasedimentary rocks display a range of metamorphic grades increasing from biotite-chlorite (280-380 °C) at ∼5 km away from the GLB to sillimanite-K-feldspar grade (∼660 °C) immediately adjacent to the batholith, thus providing a natural experiment to understand sulfur isotope variations from low- to high-grade Archean sedimentary rocks, as well as granites representative of their partial melts. We find that metasedimentary sulfide $\\delta$34S values increase with progressive metamorphism at most 2-3‰ (from −1‰ up to +1 to +2‰). An increase in $\\delta$34S values in pyrrhotite during prograde metamorphism can be explained through Rayleigh fractionation during pyrite desulfidation reactions. Pyrite from all but one of the granite samples preserve $\\delta$34S values similar to that of the high-grade metasedimentary rocks, indicating that partial melting did not result in significant fractionation of $\\delta$34S. The exception to this is one granite sample from a part of the batholith characterized by abundant metasedimentary inclusions. This sample contains pyrite with heterogeneous and low $\\delta$34S values (down to −16‰) which likely resulted from incomplete homogenization of sulfur between the granitic melt and metasedimentary inclusions. Small (several tenths of a permil), mostly positive $\\Delta$33S are observed in both the metasedimentary rocks and granites. Our results suggest that Archean strongly peraluminous granites could be a high-fidelity archive to quantify the bulk sulfur isotope composition of the Archean siliciclastic sediments. Further, our findings indicate that subduction of reduced sulfur-bearing sediments in the Archean with $\\delta$34S at or near 0‰ should result in release of sulfur-bearing fluids in the mantle wedge with similar values (within a few permil). S-MIF (if initially present in Archean surface material) may be preserved during this process. However, the absence of S-MIF in igneous rocks does not preclude assimilation of Archean sedimentary material as either S-MIF may not be originally present in the Archean sedimentary sulfur and/or homogenization or dilution could obscure any S-MIF originally present in assimilated Archean sediments.},\nauthor = {Bucholz, Claire E. and Biasi, Joseph A. and Beaudry, Patrick and Ono, Shuhei},\ndoi = {10.1016/j.epsl.2020.116494},\nissn = {0012821X},\njournal = {Earth and Planetary Science Letters},\nkeywords = {Archean,anatexis,granite,metasedimentary rocks,sulfur},\npages = {116494},\ntitle = {{Sulfur isotope behavior during metamorphism and anatexis of Archean sedimentary rocks: A case study from the Ghost Lake batholith, Ontario, Canada}},\nvolume = {549},\nyear = {2020},\nurl ={https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2020.116494}\n}',

These two deep-time cores are correlated to each other with 14 tie lines using volcanic and impact spherule layers in a sequence stratigraphic framework, allowing us to evaluate both lithofacies and temporal controls over multiple-sulfur isotope systematics. The ca. 2.5 Ga (giga-annum before present) basinal Klein Naute Formation and the ca. 2.6 Ga peritidal Boomplaas and Vryburg Formations yield an array of data characterized by $\\delta$33S ≈ 1.4 × $\\delta$34S. These linear trends are found in both shallow water and deepwater facies but are characteristic to rocks with high-iron content suggesting these may reflect isotopic compositions of aqueous sulfide-elemental sulfur reservoirs in the Neoarchean oceans. Data that deviate from this linear array are interpreted as resulting from additional inputs of sulfide from microbial sulfate reduction with or without contribution from sulfur disproportionation. Sulfate-derived sulfur evolved to be either enriched or depleted in 34S depending on the local depositional environment. For example, the Reivilo Formation in core GKF01 is characterized by abundant microbialite textures and shows an isotopic signature of closed system sulfate reduction. Rapid cementation of these carbonate fabrics may have attenuated the supply of sulfate to pore waters resulting in the progressive 34S enrichments during bacterial sulfate reduction below the sediment-water interface. In contrast, signatures of open-system sulfate reduction are associated with slope facies, dominated by granular dolostones, preserved in the upper Nauga Formations in GKF01 and GKP01. The two different sulfur isotope patterns, interpreted to reflect closed versus open-system sulfate reduction are both found in the lower Reivilo Formation in both cores. This lateral variation of isotope signals documents that observed 34S shifts can be controlled locally, and may not have temporal significance. This study demonstrates critical importance of recovering sulfur isotope data from stratigraphically correlated drill cores to evaluate both geographical and temporal shifts of sulfur cycles, and their links to the great oxidation event at the end of the Archean Eon. {\\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Characterizing the expected subtle variations in tropospheric N 2O isotopic composition demands high-precision and high-frequency measurements. To enable useful observations of N2O isotopic composition in tropospheric air to reduce N2O source and sink uncertainty, it was necessary to develop a high-precision measurement system with fully automated capabilities for autonomous deployment at remote research stations. METHODS A fully automated pre-concentration system for high-precision measurements of N2O isotopic composition ($\\delta$15N $\\beta$, $\\delta$15N$\\alpha$, $\\delta$ 18O) in tropospheric air has been developed which combines a custom liquid-cryogen-free cryo-trapping system and gas chromatograph interfaced to a continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) system. A quadrupole mass spectrometer was coupled in parallel to the IRMS system during development to evaluate peak interference. Multi-port inlet and fully-automated capabilities allow streamlined analyses between in situ air inlet, air standards, flask air sample, or other gas source in exactly replicated analysis sequences. RESULTS The system has the highest precision to date for 15N site-specific composition results ($\\delta$15N$\\alpha$ ±0.11‰, $\\delta$15N$\\beta$ ±0.14‰ (1$\\sigma$)), attributed mostly to uniformity of analytical cycles and particular attention to fluorocarbon interference noted for 15N site-specific measurements by IRMS. Air measurements demonstrated the fully automated capacity and performance. CONCLUSIONS The system makes substantial headway in measurement precision, possibly defining the limits of IRMS measurement capabilities in low concentration N2O air samples, with fully automated capabilities to enable high-frequency in situ measurements.

In this study, we investigate how the coupling of carbon and sulfur metabolisms in batch and continuous cultures of a recently isolated marine sulfate reducing bacterium DMSS-1, a Desulfovibrio sp., influences the fractionation of sulfur isotopes. DMSS-1 grown in batch culture on seven different electron donors (ethanol, glycerol, fructose, glucose, lactate, malate and pyruvate) fractionates 34S/32S ratio from 6‰ to 44‰, demonstrating that the fractionations by an actively growing culture of a single incomplete oxidizing sulfate reducing microbe can span almost the entire range of previously reported values in defined cultures. The magnitude of isotope effect correlates well with cell specific sulfate reduction rates (from 0.7 to 26.1fmol/cell/day). DMSS-1 grown on lactate in continuous culture produces a larger isotope effect (21-37‰) than the lactate-grown batch culture (6‰), indicating that the isotope effect also depends on the supply rate of the electron donor and microbial growth rate. The largest isotope effect in continuous culture is accompanied by measurable changes in cell length and cellular yield that suggest starvation. The use of multiple sulfur isotopes in the model of metabolic fluxes of sulfur shows that the loss of sulfate from the cell and the intracellular reoxidation of reduced sulfur species contribute to the increase in isotope effects in a correlated manner. Isotope fractionations produced during sulfate reduction in the pure culture of DMSS-1 expand the previously reported range of triple sulfur isotope effects (32S, 33S, and 34S) by marine sulfate reducing bacteria, implying that microbial sulfur disproportionation may have a smaller 33S isotopic fingerprint than previously thought. {\\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},\nauthor = {Sim, Min Sub and Ono, Shuhei and Donovan, Katie and Templer, Stefanie P. and Bosak, Tanja},\ndoi = {10.1016/j.gca.2011.05.021},\nfile = {:Users/shuheiono/Documents/Mendeley Desktop/Sim et al. - 2011.pdf:pdf},\nissn = {00167037},\njournal = {Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta},\nnumber = {15},\npages = {4244--4259},\ntitle = {{Effect of electron donors on the fractionation of sulfur isotopes by a marine Desulfovibrio sp}},\nvolume = {75},\nyear = {2011}\n}",

This study presents multiple sulfur isotope records of carbonate-associated sulfate (CAS) and pyrite from Late Devonian sections in the Great Basin, USA, in order to document changes in the coupled (or decoupled) geochemical cycles of carbon and sulfur during the punctata and Upper Kellwasser events. A positive sulfur isotope shift in both CAS and pyrite accompanies the onset of the punctata Event, but to a larger extent in the latter. As a result, the sulfur isotope offset between CAS and pyrite ($\\delta$34SCAS-py) dropped to less than 10‰.

The dissimilatory reduction of thiosulfate and sulfite produce unique minor isotope effects, as compared to the reduction of sulfate.

To further resolve the process(es) responsible for methane generation in these systems, we determined the relative abundances of several methane isotopologues (including 13CH3D, a “clumped” isotopologue containing two rare isotope substitutions) in hot-spring source fluids sampled from four geochemically-distinct hydrothermal vent fields (Rainbow, Von Damm, Lost City, and Lucky Strike).

Combined with very similar bulk stable isotope ratios (13C/12C and D/H) of methane across the suite of hydrothermal fluids, all available geochemical and isotopic data suggest a common mechanism of methane generation at depth that is disconnected from active fluid circulation. Attainment of equilibrium amongst methane isotopologues at temperatures of ca. 270–360 °C is compatible with the thermodynamically-favorable reduction of CO2 to CH4 at temperatures at or below ca. 400 °C under redox conditions characterizing intrusive rocks derived from sub-ridge melts.

To investigate the role of rock composition and deep circulation conditions on fluid chemistry, the abundance and isotopic composition of organic, inorganic, and dissolved volatile species in high temperature vent fluids at Piccard were examined in samples collected in 2012 and 2013. Fluids from the Beebe Vents and Beebe Woods black smokers vent at a maximum temperature of 398 °C at the seafloor, however several lines of evidence derived from inorganic chemistry (Cl, SiO2, Ca, Br, Fe, Cu, Mn) support fluid formation at much higher temperatures in the subsurface. These high temperatures, potentially in excess of 500 °C, are attainable due to the great depth of the system. Our data indicate that a single deep-rooted source fluid feeds high temperature vents across the entire Piccard field. High temperature Piccard fluid H2 abundances (19.9 mM) are even higher than those observed in many ultramafic-influenced systems, such as the Rainbow (16 mM) and the Von Damm hydrothermal fields (18.2 mM).

Experiments were performed in a 100 L quartz photochemical reactor, in which OH was produced from the reaction of O(1D) (from O3 photolysis) with H2O, and Cl was from photolysis of Cl2. Samples were taken from the reaction cell and analyzed for methane (12CH4, 12CH3D, 13CH4, 13CH3D) isotopologue ratios using tunable infrared laser direct absorption spectroscopy. Measured kinetic isotope effects for singly substituted species were consistent with previous experimental studies. For doubly substituted methane, 13CH3D, the observed kinetic isotope effects closely follow the product of the kinetic isotope effects for the 13C and deuterium substituted species (i.e., 13,2KIE = 13KIE × 2KIE). The deviation from this relationship is 0.3‰ ± 1.2‰ and 3.5‰ ± 0.7‰ for OH and Cl oxidation, respectively. This is consistent with model calculations performed using quantum chemistry and transition state theory. The OH and Cl reactions enrich the residual methane in the clumped isotopologue in open system reactions. In a closed system, however, this effect is overtaken by the large D/H isotope effect, which causes the residual methane to become anti-clumped relative to the initial methane. Based on these results, we demonstrate that oxidation of methane by OH, the predominant oxidant for tropospheric methane, will only have a minor (∼0.3‰) impact on the clumped isotope signature ($\\Delta$13CH3D, measured as a deviation from a stochastic distribution of isotopes) of tropospheric methane.

The timing of the GOE and the rate at which this oxygenation took place have been poorly constrained until now. We report the transition (that is, from being massindependent to becoming mass-dependent) in multiple sulfur isotope signals of diagenetic pyrite in a continuous sedimentary sequence in three coeval drill cores in the Transvaal Supergroup, South Africa.

The six month long 2014–15 B{\\'{a}}rðarbunga volcanic eruption was the largest in Iceland for more than 200 years and it released into the atmosphere an average of 60 kt/day SO2, 30 kt/day CO2, 500 t/day HCl and 280 t/day HF. To study the effect of this eruption on the winter precipitation, snow cores were collected from the Vatnaj{\\\"{o}}kull glacier and the highlands northeast of the glacier. In addition to 29 bulk snow cores from that precipitated from September 2014 until March 2015, two cores were sampled in 21 and 44 increments to quantify the spatial and time evolution of the chemical composition of the snow. The pH and chemical compositions of melted snow samples indicate that snow has been affected by the volcanic gases emitted during the B{\\'{a}}rðarbunga eruption. The pH of the melted bulk snow cores ranged from 4.41 to 5.64 with an average value of 5.01. This is four times greater H+ activity than pure water saturated with the atmospheric CO2. The highest concentrations of volatiles in the snow cores were found close to the eruption site as predicted from CALPUFF SO2 gas dispersion quality model. The anion concentrations (SO4, Cl, and F) were higher and the pH was lower compared to equivalent snow samples collected during 1997–2006 from the unpolluted Icelandic Langj{\\\"{o}}kull glacier. Higher SO4 and Cl concentrations in the snow compared with the unpolluted rainwater of marine origin confirm the addition of a non–seawater SO4 and Cl. The $\\delta$34S isotopic composition confirms that the sulphur addition is of volcanic aerosol origin. The chemical evolution of the snow with depth reflects changes in the lava effusion and gas emission rates. Those rates were the highest at the early stage of the eruption. Snow that fell during that time, represented by samples from the deepest part of the snow cores, had the lowest pH and highest concentrations of SO4, F, Cl and metals, compared with snow that fell later in the winter. Also the Al concentration, did exceed World Health Organisation drinking water standard of 3.7 $\\mu$mol/kg in the lower part of the snow core closest to the eruption site. Collected snow represents the precipitation that fell during the eruption period. Nevertheless, only minor environmental impacts are evident in the snow due to its interaction with the volcanic aerosol gases.

We report new CO2 and N2 isotope and relative abundance data in exceptionally gas-rich mantle peridotite and pyroxenite xenoliths from nine localities throughout the eastern branch of the East African Rift System (EARS). Importantly for our study, the xenolith localities straddle the transition between continental and oceanic lithosphere. In addition, we report major and trace element contents together with oxygen isotopes on host crystals and bulk multiple sulfur isotope data on select pyroxene crystals from the same xenolith suite. These new data are interpreted alongside previously published He, Ne and Ar isotope and relative abundance data. Pyroxenite xenoliths formed from the infiltration and crystallization of mafic melts in the lithospheric mantle. This was followed by fluids fracturing through the pyroxenites leaving gas-rich fluid inclusions. The elemental and isotope systematics of the fluid inclusion-hosted volatile species (He, Ar, N, CO2) within the mantle xenoliths are consistent with the enrichment of the EARS SCLM by CO2-rich mantle fluids from subducted carbonate-rich material. Such CO2 enrichments (CO2/3He {\textgreater} 7 × 109, δ13C {\textasciitilde}0‰) are also associated with positive δ15N values (as high as +3.4‰), reinforcing the link between the metasomatic fluids and subduction of hydrothermally altered oceanic crust. Recycled signatures are also consistent with oxygen and sulfur isotope compositions of host crystals, which are distinct from compositions typical for the depleted upper MORB-source mantle. The occurrence of recycled volatile signatures in the EARS SCLM is widespread and must therefore be associated with a large-scale mantle process currently supplying material to EARS magmas. Notably, mantle xenoliths with high 3He/4He from the Ethiopian Rift are also associated with δ15N and δ13C values similar to the composition of sediments.

The anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) is an important methane sink reaction carried out by consortia of anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) and partner bacteria in the presence of methane and sulfate. We investigated the methane isotopologue fractionations during AOM in experiments with cultures of ANME-1 archaea and partner bacteria obtained from hydrothermally heated gas-rich sediments of the Guaymas Basin.

Results from one set of experiments with D-depleted medium water (dD = –200‰, whereas the control was –55‰) suggest the potential reversibility during the methane activation step, which would contribute to equilibrium as opposed to kinetic fractionations. The value of D13CH3D (the abundance of 13CH3D with respect to that expected from stochastic distribution) increased toward and beyond (up to 8.4‰) the value expected for isotopologue equilibrium (5.3‰ at 37 °C).

Accordingly, the sulfur isotopic composition (δ34S) of pyrite has been widely employed as a geochemical tool to probe the evolution of ocean chemistry. Characteristics of the depositional environment and post-depositional processes, however, can modify the δ34S signal that is captured in sedimentary pyrite and ultimately preserved in the geological record. Exploring sulfur and iron diagenesis within the Bornholm Basin, Baltic Sea, we find that higher sedimentation rates limit the near-surface sulfidization of reactive iron, facilitating its burial and hence the subsurface availability of reactive iron for continued and progressively more 34S-enriched sediment-hosted pyrite formation (δ34S ≈ –5‰). Using a diagenetic model, we show that the amount of pyrite formed at the sediment-water interface has increased over the past few centuries in response to expansion of water-column hypoxia, which also impacts the sulfur isotopic signature of pyrite at depth. This contribution highlights the critical role of reactive iron in pyrite formation and questions to what degree pyrite δ34S values truly reflect past global ocean chemistry and biogeochemical processes. This work strengthens our ability to extract local paleoenvironmental information from pyrite δ34S signatures.}, journal = {Geology}, author = {Liu, Jiarui and Antler, Gilad and Pellerin, André and Izon, Gareth and Dohrmann, Ingrid and Findlay, Alyssa J and Røy, Hans and Ono, Shuhei and Turchyn, Alexandra V and Kasten, Sabine and Jørgensen, Bo Barker}, month = mar, year = {2021}, pages = {816--821}, }  `,

In addition to the oxidation of buried organic matter, sulfate reduction can be coupled to the oxidation of methane migrating upward. Multiple sulfur isotope ratios were measured for porewater sulfate, sulﬁde, elemental sulfur and pyrite from core samples collected from continental shelf (19–96 m water depth) in the Baltic Sea and slope (1098 m water depth) in the Andaman Sea, in order to test if their isotope systematics can be used to trace the two diﬀerent sulfate reduction processes. For shallow shelf sediments ({\textless}43 cm below seaﬂoor), both d34S and D33S values of porewater sulfate increased with increasing depth as a result of organoclastic sulfate reduction (OSR). However, the D33S values of both porewater sulfate and sulﬁde decreased as the d34S values increased downcore at 43–73 cm depth where sulfate reduction was coupled to anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). Pyrite in shelf sediments yielded positive D33S values, reﬂecting D33S of porewater sulﬁde produced by OSR. In contrast, pyrite in slope sediments yielded negative D33S values as low as À0.15‰, as a result of mixing of sulﬁdes derived from OSR and AOM. This is consistent with the slowly migrating sulfate–methane transition (SMT) in slope sediments inferred from sulfur and iron speciation, carbon isotope ratios of carbonates, and magnetic susceptibility data. A stable SMT, focusing AOM at roughly the same depth over the past few millennia, further provides favorable conditions for prolonged pyrite formation with the development of cubic crystals, while the sulfur isotope diﬀerence between bulk pyrite and macroscopic pyrite reﬂects the signiﬁcance of OSR throughout the sediment column. We conclude that minor sulfur isotopes provide a unique proxy that can be applied to diﬀerentiate OSR and AOM and the origin of pyrite in diverse sediments and sedimentary rocks.}, language = {en}, urldate = {2022-07-10}, journal = {Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta}, author = {Liu, Jiarui and Pellerin, André and Wang, Jiasheng and Rickard, David and Antler, Gilad and Zhao, Jie and Wang, Zhou and Jørgensen, Bo Barker and Ono, Shuhei}, month = jan, year = {2022}, pages = {309--330}, file = {Liu et al. - 2022 - Multiple sulfur isotopes discriminate organoclasti.pdf:/Users/shuheiono/Zotero/storage/3ICSMF56/Liu et al. - 2022 - Multiple sulfur isotopes discriminate organoclasti.pdf:application/pdf}, }  `,

However, processes such as boiling, magma degassing, fluid-rock interaction and associated redox reactions often obscure the origin of sulfur in the system. The multiple sulfur isotope system is a powerful tool to unravel the processes that affect isotope ratios of sulfur in geothermal systems. Here, we utilized concentrations and multiple isotope ratios (32S/33S/34S/36S) of sulfur from well discharge from geothermal fields at Olkaria, SE Kenya, to investigate the hydrothermal processes and to quantify the sources of sulfur to the system. Fluid sampling temperatures ranged from 157 to 204 ◦C, and the sampled fluids had low Cl concentrations (119 to 1267 ppm Cl) with both liquid water and vapor being present. The concentration of H2S and SO4 in the water phase of the well discharges ranged from 0.53 to 68.0 ppm and from 4.7 to 108 ppm, respectively. In the vapor phase, H2S was the only observed sulfur compound with concentrations between 1.18 and 214 μmol mol− 1. In the water phase, δ34S values for H2S and SO4 ranged from − 1.2 to +4.0‰ and +0.7 to +7.7‰, respectively. The δ34S values of H2S in the vapor phase ranged from +2.0 to +11.3‰. The Δ33S values for H2S in the water and vapor phase were found to be between − 0.017 and +0.021‰ and − 0.042 and +0.008‰, respectively, and for SO4 in the water phase between − 0.024 and + 0.004‰. Sulfur isotopes of H2S in liquid phase were depleted in 34S as a result of depressurization boiling. Sulfur isotope ratios as well as the results of geochemical modelling suggest that sulfide in the fluids dominantly originated from rock leaching where insignificant amounts of sulfur was derived from direct degassing of a magmatic source. Sulfate primarily derived from the oxidation of H2S to SO4 upon fluid ascent to the surface. Based on the geochemical model results and measured sulfur concentrations, the annual natural H2S emission rate at Olkaria was estimated to range from 320 to 510 t H2S yr− 1. These comparatively low sulfur emissions and the lack of significant sulfur sources (e.g., magma or seawater) imply that Olkaria could represent an ideal re-injection site for anthropogenic H2S even if sulfur sequestration rates would be low.}, language = {en}, urldate = {2022-07-10}, journal = {Chemical Geology}, author = {Kleine, Barbara I. and Gunnarsson-Robin, Jóhann and Kamunya, Kennedy M. and Ono, Shuhei and Stefánsson, Andri}, month = nov, year = {2021}, pages = {120446}, file = {Kleine et al. - 2021 - Source controls on sulfur abundance and isotope fr.pdf:/Users/shuheiono/Zotero/storage/C9NQBRYW/Kleine et al. - 2021 - Source controls on sulfur abundance and isotope fr.pdf:application/pdf}, }  `,

While sulfur isotope ratio analyses of materials such as bulk rock samples, gases, and sulfide grains are routinely carried out, in-situ an­ alyses of silicate glasses such as those formed in magmatic systems are relatively scarce in the literature. Despite a number of attempts in recent years to analyse sulfur isotope ratios in volcanic and experimental glasses by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), the effects of instrumental mass fractionation (IMF) during analysis remain poorly understood. In this study we use more than 600 sulfur isotope analyses of nine different glasses to characterise the matrix effects that arise during sulfur isotope analysis of glasses by SIMS. Samples were characterised for major element composition, sulfur content, and sulfur isotope ratios by independent methods. Our glasses contain between 500 and 3400 ppm sulfur and cover a wide compositional range, including low-silica basanite, rhyolite, and phonolite, allowing us to investigate composition-dependent IMF. We use SIMS in multi-collection mode with a Faraday cup/ electron multiplier detector configuration to achieve uncertainty of 0.3‰ to 2‰ (2σ) on measured δ34S. At high sulfur content, the analytical error of our SIMS analyses is similar to that of bulk analytical methods, such as gas-source isotope ratio mass spectrometry. We find IMF causes an offset of − 12‰ to +1‰ between bulk sulfur isotope ratios and those measured by SIMS. Instrumental mass fractionation correlates non-linearly with glass sulfur contents and with a multivariate regression model combining glass Al, Na, and K contents. Both ln(S) and Al-Na-K models are capable of predicting IMF with good accuracy: 84\% (ln(S)) and 87\% (Al-Na-K) of our analyses can be reproduced within 2σ combined analytical uncertainty after a correction for composition-dependent IMF is applied. The process driving IMF is challenging to identify. The non-linear correlation between glass S content and IMF in our dataset resembles previously documented correlation between glass H2O abundance and IMF during D/H ratio analyses by SIMS, and could be attributed to changes in 32S− and 34S− ion yields with changing S content and glass composition. However, a clear correlation between S ion yields and S content cannot be identified in our dataset. We speculate that accumulation of alkalis at the SIMS crater floor may be the principal driving force of composition-dependent IMF. Nonetheless, other currently unknown factors could also influence IMF observed during S isotope ratio analyses of glasses by SIMS. Our results demonstrate that the use of multiple, well-characterised standards with a wide compo­ sitional range is required to calibrate SIMS instruments prior to sulfur isotope analyses of unknown silicate glasses. Matrix effects related to glass Al-Na-K contents are of particular importance for felsic systems, where alkali and aluminium contents can vary considerably more than in mafic magmas.}, language = {en}, urldate = {2022-07-10}, journal = {Chemical Geology}, author = {Taracsák, Z. and Neave, D.A. and Beaudry, P. and Gunnarsson-Robin, J. and Burgess, R. and Edmonds, M. and Halldórsson, S.A. and Longpré, M-A. and Ono, S. and Ranta, E. and Stefánsson, A. and Turchyn, A.V. and {Eimf} and Hartley, M.E.}, month = sep, year = {2021}, pages = {120318}, file = {Taracsák et al. - 2021 - Instrumental mass fractionation during sulfur isot.pdf:/Users/shuheiono/Zotero/storage/KTZGBPQD/Taracsák et al. - 2021 - Instrumental mass fractionation during sulfur isot.pdf:application/pdf}, }`,
